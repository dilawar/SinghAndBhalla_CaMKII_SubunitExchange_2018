We put N CaMKII in a cylinder of radius \SI{30}{\nano\meter}, length=NL nm where
L is the length of each voxel. All CaMKII are uniformly distributed.  Diffusion
coefficient of subunits are D~x~ and for PP1 its is D~PP1~. Usually D~x~=D~PP1~.

# Summary 

In all simulation, distance between all voxels are set to \SI{40}{\nano\meter},
the average nearest neighbour distance (see

for details or [this paper](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/23/35/11270)).
