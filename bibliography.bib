	abstract = {In many regions of the brain, including the mammalian cortex, the strength of synaptic transmission can be bidirectionally regulated by cortical activity (synaptic plasticity). One line of evidence indicates that long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) and long-term synaptic depression (LTD), correlate with the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of sites on the α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunit protein GluR1. Bidirectional synaptic plasticity can be induced by different frequencies of presynaptic stimulation, but there is considerable evidence indicating that the key variable is calcium influx through postsynaptic N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Here, we present a biophysical model of bidirectional synaptic plasticity based on [Ca2+]-dependent phospho/dephosphorylation of the GluR1 subunit of the AMPA receptor. The primary assumption of the model, for which there is wide experimental support, is that the postsynaptic calcium concentration, and consequent activation of calcium-dependent protein kinases and phosphatases, is the trigger for phosphorylation/dephosphorylation at GluR1 and consequent induction of LTP/LTD. We explore several different mathematical approaches, all of them based on mass-action assumptions. First, we use a first order approach, in which transition rates are functions of an activator, in this case calcium. Second, we adopt the Michaelis-Menten approach with different assumptions about the signal transduction cascades, ranging from abstract to more detailed and biologically plausible models. Despite the different assumptions made in each model, in each case, LTD is induced by a moderate increase in postsynaptic calcium and LTP is induced by high Ca2+ concentration.},

	abstract = {Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a synaptic, autophosphorylating kinase that is essential for learning and memory. Previous models have suggested that CaMKII functions as a bistable switch that could be the molecular correlate of long-term memory, but experiments have failed to validate these predictions. These models involved significant approximations to overcome the combinatorial complexity inherent in a multisubunit, multistate system. Here, we develop a stochastic particle-based model of CaMKII activation and dynamics that overcomes combinatorial complexity without significant approximations. We report four major findings. First, the CaMKII model system is never bistable at resting calcium concentrations, which suggests that CaMKII activity does not function as the biochemical switch underlying long-term memory. Second, the steady-state activation curves are either laserlike or steplike. Both are characterized by a well-defined threshold for activation, which suggests that thresholding is a robust feature of this system. Third, transiently activated CaMKII can maintain its activity over the time course of many experiments, and such slow deactivation may account for the few reports of bistability in the literature. And fourth, under in vivo conditions, increases in phosphatase activity can increase CaMKII activity. This is a surprising and counterintuitive effect, as dephosphorylation is generally associated with CaMKII deactivation.},

Cortical pyramidal neurons receive thousands of synaptic inputs arriving at different dendritic locations with varying degrees of temporal synchrony. It is not known if different locations along single cortical dendrites integrate excitatory inputs in different ways. Here we have used two-photon glutamate uncaging and compartmental modeling to reveal a gradient of nonlinear synaptic integration in basal and apical oblique dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons. Excitatory inputs to the proximal dendrite sum linearly and require precise temporal coincidence for effective summation, whereas distal inputs are amplified with high gain and integrated over broader time windows. This allows distal inputs to overcome their electrotonic disadvantage, and become surprisingly more effective than proximal inputs at influencing action potential output. Thus, single dendritic branches can already exhibit nonuniform synaptic integration, with the computational strategy shifting from temporal coding to rate coding along the dendrite.},

	abstract = {Noise can degrade memories by causing transitions from one memory state to another. For any biological memory system to be useful, the time scale of such noise-induced transitions must be much longer than the required duration for memory retention. Using biophysically-realistic modeling, we consider two types of memory in the brain: short-term memories maintained by reverberating neuronal activity for a few seconds, and long-term memories maintained by a molecular switch for years. Both systems require persistence of (neuronal or molecular) activity self-sustained by an autocatalytic process and, we argue, that both have limited memory lifetimes because of significant fluctuations. We will first discuss a strongly recurrent cortical network model endowed with feedback loops, for short-term memory. Fluctuations are due to highly irregular spike firing, a salient characteristic of cortical neurons. Then, we will analyze a model for long-term memory, based on an autophosphorylation mechanism of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) molecules. There, fluctuations arise from the fact that there are only a small number of CaMKII molecules at each postsynaptic density (putative synaptic memory unit). Our results are twofold. First, we demonstrate analytically and computationally the exponential dependence of stability on the number of neurons in a self-excitatory network, and on the number of CaMKII proteins in a molecular switch. Second, for each of the two systems, we implement graded memory consisting of a group of bistable switches. For the neuronal network we report interesting ramping temporal dynamics as a result of sequentially switching an increasing number of discrete, bistable, units. The general observation of an exponential increase in memory stability with the system size leads to a trade-off between the robustness of memories (which increases with the size of each bistable unit) and the total amount of information storage (which decreases with increasing unit size), which may be optimized in the brain through biological evolution.},

	abstract = {Cells sense and respond to the world around them using signaling “circuits” made of proteins and other molecules, and when an important cell circuit breaks, diseases like cancer may arise. Much like with electrical circuits, a given set of molecular components can be used to build different signaling circuits that behave in different ways. However, unlike for electrical circuits we generally do not have design manuals that allow us to work out how a signaling circuit behaves based on the components it includes. Doing this would involve identifying all the molecular parts of a circuit, using them to build every possible circuit, and carefully measuring the associated behavior. A group of proteins called the Ras-superfamily GTPases are important controllers of cell behavior. To investigate the behavior of Ras GTPase signaling circuits, Coyle and Lim built up different circuits from their components and “watched” their behavior with a microscope. Analyzing these behaviors provided the information needed to produce a ‘design manual’ for programming Ras circuits. Coyle and Lim found that the makeup of a Ras signaling circuit strongly affects the timing, duration, shape and size of its output. This means that different cells can use the same core components in different ways to build circuits customized to their specific needs. Nonetheless, this versatility comes with a trade-off: the circuits are fragile, and can break in many different ways to cause disease. In the future Coyle and Lim aim to build other types of important cellular signaling circuits from their component parts. Only by building these systems, turning them on and watching them run can we begin to understand how they actually perform and what they are capable of.},

However, they have not been extensively studied in modular networks. Here, we consider the neural network of the {\textbackslash}textit\{C.elegans\} soil worm, organized into six interconnected communities, where neurons obey chaotic bursting dynamics. Neurons are assumed to be connected with electrical synapses within their communities and with chemical synapses across them. As our numerical simulations reveal, the coaction of these two types of coupling can shape the dynamics in such a way that chimera-like states can happen. They consist of a fraction of synchronized neurons which belong to the larger communities, and a fraction of desynchronized neurons which are part of smaller communities. In addition to the Kuramoto order parameter \${\textbackslash}rho\$, we also employ other measures of coherence, such as the chimera-like \${\textbackslash}chi\$ and metastability \${\textbackslash}lambda\$ indices, which quantify the degree of synchronization among communities and along time, respectively. We perform the same analysis for networks that share common features with the {\textbackslash}textit\{C.elegans\} neural network. Similar results suggest that under certain assumptions, chimera-like states are prominent phenomena in modular networks, and might provide insight for the behavior of more complex modular networks.},

In natural situations, agents may have a priori on their preferences that create default policies and shape the neural comparison process. We asked participants to make choices between items belonging to different categories (e.g., jazz vs. rock music). Behavioral data confirmed that items taken from the preferred category were chosen more often and more rapidly, which qualified them as default options. FMRI data showed that baseline activity in classical brain valuation regions, such as the ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (vmPFC), reflected the strength of prior preferences. In addition, evoked activity in the same regions scaled with the default option value, irrespective of the eventual choice. We therefore suggest that in the brain valuation system, choices are framed as comparisons between default and alternative options, which might save some resource but induce a decision bias.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an algorithm for approximating certain types of dynamical systems given by a system of ordinary delay differential equations by a Boolean network model. Often Boolean models are much simpler to understand than complex differential equations models. The motivation for this work comes from mathematical systems biology. While Boolean mechanisms do not provide information about exact concentration rates or time scales, they are often sufficient to capture steady states and other key dynamics. Due to their intuitive nature, such models are very appealing to researchers in the life sciences. This paper is focused on dynamical systems that exhibit bistability and are desc ribedby delay equations. It is shown that if a certain motif including a feedback loop is present in the wiring diagram of the system, the Boolean model captures the bistability of molecular switches. The method is appl ied to two examples from biology, the lac operon and the phage lambda lysis/lysogeny switch.},

	abstract = {A mathematical model is presented of autophosphorylation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) and its dephosphorylation by a phosphatase. If the total concentration of CaMKII subunits is significantly higher than the phosphatase Michaelis constant, two stable steady states of the CaMKII autophosphorylation can exist in a Ca2+ concentration range from below the resting value of the intracellular [Ca2+] to the threshold concentration for induction of long-term potentiation (LTP). Bistability is a robust phenomenon, it occurs over a wide range of parameters of the model. Ca2+ transients that switch CaMKII from the low-phosphorylated state to the high-phosphorylated one are in the same range of amplitudes and frequencies as the Ca2+ transients that induce LTP. These results show that the CaMKII-phosphatase bistability may play an important role in long-term synaptic modifications. They also suggest a plausible explanation for the very high concentrations of CaMKII found in postsynaptic densities of cerebral neurons.},

Long-term plasticity denotes the synaptic changes that last more than 20–30 min (see Fig. 1).

The calcium-independent autophosphorylation could further prolong the active state by opposing dephosphorylation by cellular phosphatases.},

The CS theory comprises a mathematical framework that describes how and under which conditions, restricted sampling of information (data set) can lead to condensed, yet concise, forms of the initial, subsampled information entity (i.e. of the original data set). In this work, hippocampus related regions and their respective circuitry are presented as a CS-based system whose different components collaborate to realize efficient memory encoding and decoding processes. This proposition introduces a unifying mathematical framework for hippocampal function and opens new avenues for exploring coding and decoding strategies in the brain.},

The extent to which single neurons actually change remains largely unstudied, however. To evaluate how functional properties of single neurons change over time, we devised a way to perform in vivo time-lapse electrophysiological recordings from the exact same neuron. We monitored the contralateral and ipsilateral sensory-evoked spiking activity of individual L2/3 neurons from the somatosensory cortex of mice. At the end of the first recording session, we electroporated the neuron with a DNA plasmid to drive GFP expression. Then, 2 wk later, we visually guided a recording electrode in vivo to the GFP-expressing neuron for the second time. We found that contralateral and ipsilateral evoked responses (i.e., probability to respond, latency, and preference), and spontaneous activity of individual L2/3 pyramidal neurons are stable under control conditions, but that this stability could be rapidly disrupted. Contralateral whisker deprivation induced robust changes in sensory-evoked response profiles of single neurons. Our experiments provide a framework for studying the stability and plasticity of single neurons over long time scales using electrophysiology.},

In this study, we have completed the identification of most major proteins in the PSD fraction with the use of an analytical method based on mass spectrometry coupled with searching of the protein sequence databases. At least one protein in each of 26 prominent protein bands from the PSD fraction has now been identified. We found 7 proteins not previously known to be constituents of the PSD fraction and 24 that had previously been associated with the PSD by other methods. The newly identified proteins include the heavy chain of myosin-Va (dilute myosin), a motor protein thought to be involved in vesicle trafficking, and the mammalian homolog of the yeast septin protein cdc10, which is important for bud formation in yeast. Both myosin-Va and cdc10 are threefold to fivefold enriched in the PSD fraction over brain homogenates. Immunocytochemical localization of myosin-Va in cultured hippocampal neurons shows that it partially colocalizes with PSD-95 at synapses and is also diffusely localized in cell bodies, dendrites, and axons. Cdc10 has a punctate distribution in cell bodies and dendrites, with some of the puncta colocalizing with PSD-95. The results support a role for myosin-Va in transport of materials into spines and for septins in the formation or maintenance of spines.},

	abstract = {The actions of dopamine D1 family receptors (D1R) depend upon a signal transduction cascade that modulates the phosphorylation state of important effector proteins, such as glutamate receptors and ion channels. This is accomplished both through activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and the inhibition of protein phosphatase-1 (PP1). Inhibition of PP1 occurs through PKA-mediated phosphorylation of dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein 32 kDa (DARPP-32) or the related protein inhibitor-1 (I-1), and the availability of DARPP-32 is essential to the functional outcome of D1R activation in the basal ganglia. While D1R activation is critical for prefrontal cortex (PFC) function, especially working memory, the functional role played by DARPP-32 or I-1 is less clear. In order to examine this more thoroughly, we have utilized immunoelectron microscopy to quantitatively determine the localization of DARPP-32 and I-1 in the neuropil of the rhesus monkey PFC. Both were distributed widely in the different components of the neuropil, but were enriched in dendritic shafts. I-1 label was more frequently identified in axon terminals than was DARPP-32, and DARPP-32 label was more frequently identified in glia than was I-1. We also quantified the extent to which these proteins were found in dendritic spines. DARPP-32 and I-1 were present in small subpopulations of dendritic spines, (4.4\% and 7.7\% and respectively), which were substantially smaller than observed for D1R in our previous studies (20\%). Double-label experiments did not find evidence for colocalization of D1R and DARPP-32 or I-1 in spines or terminals. Thus, at the least, not all prefrontal spines which contain D1R also contain I-1 or DARPP-32, suggesting important differences in D1R signaling in the PFC compared to the striatum.},

	abstract = {The strength of hippocampal synapses can be persistently increased by signals that activate Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). This CaMKII-dependent long-term potentiation is important for hippocampal learning and memory. In this work we show that CaMKII exhibits an intriguing switch-like activation that likely is important for changes in synaptic strength. We found that autophosphorylation of CaMKII by itself showed a steep dependence on Ca2+ concentration [Hill coefficient (nH) approximately 5]. However, an even steeper Ca2+ dependence (nH approximately 8) was observed when autophosphorylation is balanced by the dephosphorylation activity of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). This autophosphorylation-dephosphorylation switch was found to be reversible because PP1 dephosphorylates CaMKII when Ca2+ is lowered to a basal level. The switch-like response of a CaMKII-PP1 system suggests that CaMKII and PP1 may function together as a simple molecular device that specifically translates only strong Ca2+ signals into all-or-none potentiation of individual hippocampal synapses.},

	abstract = {Memories are stored, at least partly, as patterns of strong synapses. Given molecular turnover, how can synapses maintain strong for the years that memories can persist? Some models postulate that biochemical bistability maintains strong synapses. However, bistability should give a bimodal distribution of synaptic strength or weight, whereas current data show unimodal distributions for weights and for a correlated variable, dendritic spine volume. Thus it is important for models to simulate both unimodal distributions and long-term memory persistence. Here a model is developed that connects ongoing, competing processes of synaptic growth and weakening to stochastic processes of receptor insertion and removal in dendritic spines. The model simulates long-term ({\textgreater}1 yr) persistence of groups of strong synapses. A unimodal weight distribution results. For stability of this distribution it proved essential to incorporate resource competition between synapses organized into small clusters. With competition, these clusters are stable for years. These simulations concur with recent data to support the “clustered plasticity hypothesis” which suggests clusters, rather than single synaptic contacts, may be a fundamental unit for storage of long-term memory. The model makes empirical predictions and may provide a framework to investigate mechanisms maintaining the balance between synaptic plasticity and stability of memory.},

Here we applied highly sensitive freeze-fracture replica labeling to laminae I–II of the spinal dorsal horn of rats and investigated the numbers, densities, and colocalization of AMPA- and NMDA-type glutamate receptors at individual postsynaptic membrane specializations with a high resolution. All glutamatergic postsynaptic membranes in laminae I–II expressed AMPA receptors, and most of them (96\%) were also immunoreactive for the NR1 subunit of NMDA receptors. The numbers of gold particles for AMPA and NMDA receptors at individual postsynaptic membranes showed a linear correlation with the size of postsynaptic membrane specializations and varied in the range of 8–214 and 5–232 with median values of 37 and 28, whereas their densities varied in the range of 325–3365/μm2 and 102–2263/μm2 with median values of 1115/μm2 and 777/μm2, respectively. Virtually all (99\%) glutamatergic postsynaptic membranes expressed GluR2, and most of them (87\%) were also immunoreactive for GluR1. The numbers of gold particles for pan-AMPA, NR1, and GluR2 subunits showed a linear correlation with the size of postsynaptic surface areas. Concerning GluR1, there may be two populations of synapses with high and low GluR1 densities. In synapses larger than 0.1 μm2, GluR1 subunits were recovered in very low numbers. Differential expression of GluR1 and GluR2 subunits suggests regulation of AMPA receptor subunit composition by presynaptic mechanism.},

This push/pull regulatory theme carries through to the molecular level at excitatory synapses, where protein function is controlled through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation by kinases and phosphatases. However, these opposing enzymatic activities are only part of the equation as scaffolding interactions and assembly of multi-protein complexes are further required for efficient, localized synaptic signaling. This review will focus on coordination of postsynaptic serine/threonine kinase and phosphatase signaling by scaffold proteins during synaptic plasticity.},

	abstract = {Localization of the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) to dendritic spine synapses is determined in part by the actin cytoskeleton. We determined binding of GFP-tagged CaMKII to tag-RFP-labeled actin cytoskeleton within live cells using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and single-molecule tracking. Stepwise photobleaching showed that CaMKII formed oligomeric complexes. Photoactivation experiments demonstrated that diffusion out of the evanescent field determined the track lifetimes. Latrunculin treatment triggered a coupled loss of actin stress fibers and the colocalized, long-lived CaMKII tracks. The CaMKIIα (α) isoform, which was previously thought to lack F-actin interactions, also showed binding, but this was threefold weaker than that observed for CaMKIIβ (β). The βE' splice variant bound more weakly than α, showing that binding by β depends critically on the interdomain linker. The mutations βT287D and αT286D, which mimic autophosphorylation states, also abolished F-actin binding. Autophosphorylation triggers autonomous CaMKII activity, but does not impair GluN2B binding, another important synaptic protein interaction of CaMKII. The CaMKII inhibitor tatCN21 or CaMKII mutations that inhibit GluN2B association by blocking binding of ATP (βK43R and αK42M) or Ca(2+)/calmodulin (βA303R) had no effect on the interaction with F-actin. These results provide the first rationale for the reduced synaptic spine localization of the αT286D mutant, indicating that transient F-actin binding contributes to the synaptic localization of the CaMKIIα isoform. The track lifetime distributions had a stretched exponential form consistent with a heterogeneously diffusing population. This heterogeneity suggests that CaMKII adopts different F-actin binding modes, which is most easily rationalized by multiple subunit contacts between the CaMKII dodecamer and the F-actin cytoskeleton that stabilize the initial weak (micromolar) monovalent interaction.},

	abstract = {Repetition in learning is a prerequisite for the formation of accurate and long-lasting memory. Practice is most effective when widely distributed over time, rather than when closely spaced or massed. But even after efficient learning, most memories dissipate with time unless frequently used. The molecular mechanisms of these time-dependent constraints on learning and memory are unknown. Here we show that protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) determines the efficacy of learning and memory by limiting acquisition and favouring memory decline. When PP1 is genetically inhibited during learning, short intervals between training episodes are sufficient for optimal performance. The enhanced learning correlates with increased phosphorylation of cyclic AMP-dependent response element binding (CREB) protein, of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and of the GluR1 subunit of the AMPA receptor; it also correlates with CREB-dependent gene expression that, in control mice, occurs only with widely distributed training. Inhibition of PP1 prolongs memory when induced after learning, suggesting that PP1 also promotes forgetting. This property may account for ageing-related cognitive decay, as old mutant animals had preserved memory. Our findings emphasize the physiological importance of PP1 as a suppressor of learning and memory, and as a potential mediator of cognitive decline during ageing.},

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) contributes to the generation of complexes which are essential to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). As such, mtDNA is directly integrated into mitochondrial biogenesis and signaling and regulates mitochondrial metabolism in concert with nuclear-encoded mitochondrial factors. Mitochondria are a highly dynamic, pleiomorphic network that undergoes fission and fusion events. Within this network, mtDNAs are packaged into structures called nucleoids which are actively distributed in discrete foci within the network. This sensitive organelle is frequently disrupted by insults such as oxidants and inflammatory cytokines, and undergoes genomic damage with double- and single-strand breaks that impair its function. Collectively, mtDNA is emerging as a highly sensitive indicator of cellular stress, which is directly integrated into the mitochondrial network as a contributor of a wide range of critical signaling pathways.},

The subunits of CaMKII are bound together into the holoenzyme by the association domain, a C-terminal region of ≈ 140 residues in the CaMKII polypeptide. Single particle analyses of electron micrographs have suggested previously that the holoenyzme forms a dodecamer that contains two stacked 6-fold symmetric rings. In contrast, a recent crystal structure of the isolated association domain of mouse CaMKIIα has revealed a tetradecameric assembly with two stacked 7-fold symmetric rings. In this study, we have determined the crystal structure of the Caenorhabditis elegans CaMKII association domain and it too forms a tetradecamer. We also show by electron microscopy that in its fully assembled form the CaMKII holoenzyme is a dodecamer but without the kinase domains, either from expression of the isolated association domain in bacteria or following their removal by proteolysis, the association domains form a tetradecamer. We speculate that the holoenzyme is held in its 6-fold symmetric state by the interactions of the N-terminal ≈ 1–335 residues and that the removal of this region allows the association domain to convert into a more stable 7-fold symmetric form.},

A good candidate for the storage mechanism is Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II). CaM kinase II is one of the most prominent protein kinases, present in essentially every tissue but most concentrated in brain. Although it has been about a quarter of a century since the finding, CaM kinase II has been of the major interest in the region of brain science. It plays a multifunctional role in many intracellular events, and the expression of the enzyme is carefully regulated in brain regions and during brain development. Neuronal CaM kinase II regulates important neuronal functions, including neurotransmitter synthesis, neurotransmitter release, modulation of ion channel activity, cellular transport, cell morphology and neurite extension, synaptic plasticity, learning and memory, and gene expression. Studies concerning this kinase have provided insight into the molecular basis of nerve functions, especially learning and memory, and indicate one direction for studies in the field of neuroscience. This review presents the molecular structure, properties and functions of CaM kinase II, as a major component of neurons, based mainly developed on findings made in our laboratory.},

	abstract = {CaMKII is a major synaptic protein that is activated during the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) by the Ca2+ influx through NMDARs. This activation is required for LTP induction, but the role of the kinase in the maintenance of LTP is less clear. Elucidating the mechanisms of maintenance may provide insights into the molecular processes that underlie the stability of stored memories. In this brief review, we will outline the criteria for evaluating an LTP maintenance mechanism. The specific hypothesis evaluated is that LTP is maintained by the complex of activated CaMKII with the NMDAR. The evidence in support of this hypothesis is substantial, but further experiments are required, notably to determine the time course and persistence of complex after LTP induction. Additional work is also required to elucidate how the CaMKII/NMDAR complex produces the structural growth of the synapse that underlies late LTP. It has been proposed by Frey and Morris that late LTP involves the setting of a molecular tag during LTP induction, which subsequently allows the activated synapse to capture the proteins responsible for late LTP. However, the molecular processes by which this leads to the structural growth that underlies late LTP are completely unclear. Based on known binding reactions, we suggest the first molecularly specific version of tag/capture hypothesis: that the CaMKII/NMDAR complex, once formed, serves as a tag, which then leads to a binding cascade involving densin, delta-catenin, and N-cadherin (some of which are newly synthesized). Delta-catenin binds AMPA-binding protein (ABP), leading to the LTP-induced increase in AMPA channel content. The addition of postsynaptic N-cadherin, and the complementary increase on the presynaptic side, leads to a trans-synaptically coordinated increase in synapse size (and more release sites). It is suggested that synaptic strength is stored stably through the combined actions of the CaMKII/NMDAR complex and N-cadherin dimers. These N-cadherin pairs have redundant storage that could provide informational stability in a manner analogous to the base-pairing in DNA.},

The zebra finch, for example, sings a highly stereotyped song that is stable for years, but it is not known whether the precise neural patterns underlying song are stable or shift from day to day. Here we demonstrate that the population of projection neurons coding for song in the premotor nucleus, HVC, change from day to day. The most dramatic shifts occur over intervals of sleep. In contrast to the transient participation of excitatory neurons, ensemble measurements dominated by inhibition persist unchanged even after damage to downstream motor nerves. These observations offer a principle of motor stability: spatiotemporal patterns of inhibition can maintain a stable scaffold for motor dynamics while the population of principal neurons that directly drive behavior shift from one day to the next.},

This parsimonious model accumulates noisy pieces of evidence toward a decision bound to explain the accuracy and reaction times of subjects. Recently, Bayesian models have been proposed to explain how the brain extracts information from noisy input as typically presented in perceptual decision making tasks. It has long been known that the drift-diffusion model is tightly linked with such functional Bayesian models but the precise relationship of the two mechanisms was never made explicit. Using a Bayesian model, we derived the equations which relate parameter values between these models. In practice we show that this equivalence is useful when fitting multi-subject data. We further show that the Bayesian model suggests different decision variables which all predict equal responses and discuss how these may be discriminated based on neural correlates of accumulated evidence. In addition, we discuss extensions to the Bayesian model which would be difficult to derive for the drift-diffusion model. We suggest that these and other extensions may be highly useful for deriving new experiments which test novel hypotheses.},

While this variability is presumed to arise from overlapping synaptic input, its precise relationship to local circuit architecture remains unclear. We combine computational models and in vivo recordings to study the relationship between the spatial structure of connectivity and correlated variability in neural circuits. Extending the theory of networks with balanced excitation and inhibition, we find that spatially localized lateral projections promote weakly correlated spiking, but broader lateral projections produce a distinctive spatial correlation structure: nearby neuron pairs are positively correlated, pairs at intermediate distances are negatively correlated and distant pairs are weakly correlated. This non-monotonic dependence of correlation on distance is revealed in a new analysis of recordings from superficial layers of macaque primary visual cortex. Our findings show that incorporating distance-dependent connectivity improves the extent to which balanced network theory can explain correlated neural variability.},

However, emerging evidence supports a direct role in information processing, while storage of synaptic information may instead be mediated by regulated interaction of CaMKII with the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) complex. These and other CaMKII regulation mechanisms are discussed here in the context of the kinase structure and their impact on post-synaptic functions. Recent findings also implicate CaMKII in long-term depression (LTD), as well as functional roles at inhibitory synapses, lending renewed emphasis on better understanding the spatio-temporal control of CaMKII regulation.},

The mechanism by which subunit exchange occurs remains elusive. We show that the human CaMKII holoenzyme exists in dodecameric and tetradecameric forms, and that the calmodulin (CaM)-binding element of CaMKII can bind to the hub of the holoenzyme and destabilize it to release dimers. The structures of CaMKII from two distantly diverged organisms suggest that the CaM-binding element of activated CaMKII acts as a wedge by docking at intersubunit interfaces in the hub. This converts the hub into a spiral form that can release or gain CaMKII dimers. Our data reveal a three-way competition for the CaM-binding element, whereby phosphorylation biases it towards the hub interface, away from the kinase domain and calmodulin, thus unlocking the ability of activated CaMKII holoenzymes to exchange dimers with unactivated ones.},

Notably, the fast improvement of imaging instruments has not been reflected in the optimization of biological sample preparation. During recent years, large efforts have been made to generate affinity probes smaller than conventional antibodies adapted for fluorescent super-resolution imaging.

	abstract = {During the acquisition of memories, influx of Ca2+ into the postsynaptic spine through the pores of activated N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptors triggers processes that change the strength of excitatory synapses. The pattern of Ca2+influx during the first few seconds of activity is interpreted within the Ca2+-dependent signaling network such that synaptic strength is eventually either potentiated or depressed. Many of the critical signaling enzymes that control synaptic plasticity,including Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), are regulated by calmodulin, a small protein that can bindup to 4 Ca2+ ions. As a first step toward clarifying how the Ca2+-signaling network decides between potentiation or depression, we have created a kinetic model of the interactions of Ca2+, calmodulin, and CaMKII that represents our best understanding of the dynamics of these interactions under conditions that resemble those in a postsynaptic spine. We constrained parameters of the model from data in the literature, or from our own measurements, and then predicted time courses of activation and autophosphorylation of CaMKII under a variety of conditions. Simulations showed that species of calmodulin with fewer than four bound Ca2+ play a significant role in activation of CaMKII in the physiological regime,supporting the notion that processing of Ca2+ signals in a spine involves competition among target enzymes for binding to unsaturated species of CaM in an environment in which the concentration of Ca2+ is fluctuating rapidly. Indeed, we showed that dependence of activation on the frequency of Ca2+ transients arises from the kinetics of interaction of fluctuating Ca2+with calmodulin/CaMKII complexes. We used parameter sensitivity analysis to identify which parameters will be most beneficial to measure more carefully to improve the accuracy of predictions. This model provides a quantitative base from which to build more complex dynamic models of postsynaptic signal transduction during learning.},

However, attempts to inhibit the expression of LTP with CaMKII inhibitors have yielded inconsistent results. Here we compare the changes in CaMKII autonomous activity and phosphorylation at Thr286 of αCaMKII in rat hippocampal slices using chemical or tetanic stimulation to produce either LTP or short-term potentiation (STP). Tetanus-induced LTP in area CA1 requires CaMKII activation and Thr286 phosphorylation of αCaMKII, but we did not observe an increase in autonomous activity. Next we induced LTP by 10 min exposure to 25 mm tetraethyl-ammonium (TEA) or 5 min exposure to 41 mm potassium (K) after pretreatment with calyculin A. Exposure to K alone produced STP. These protocols allowed us to monitor temporal changes in autonomous activity during and after exposure to the potentiating chemical stimulus. In chemically induced LTP, autonomous activity was maximally increased within 30 s whereas this increase was significantly delayed in STP. However, in both LTP and STP the two-fold increase in autonomous activity measured immediately after stimulation was short-lived, returning to baseline within 2–5 min after re-exposure to normal ACSF. In LTP, but not in STP, the phosphorylation of αCaMKII at Thr286 persisted for at least 60 min after stimulation. These results confirm that LTP is associated with a maintained increase in autophosphorylation at Thr286 but indicate that a persistent increase in the autonomous activity οf CaMKII is not required for the expression of LTP.},

To understand the computational principles behind these intricate networks of interactions, we construct a broad class of synaptic models that efficiently harness biological complexity to preserve numerous memories by protecting them against the adverse effects of overwriting. The memory capacity scales almost linearly with the number of synapses, which is a substantial improvement over the square root scaling of previous models. This was achieved by combining multiple dynamical processes that initially store memories in fast variables and then progressively transfer them to slower variables. Notably, the interactions between fast and slow variables are bidirectional. The proposed models are robust to parameter perturbations and can explain several properties of biological memory, including delayed expression of synaptic modifications, metaplasticity, and spacing effects.

	abstract = {The detection and discrimination of temporal sequences is fundamental to brain function and underlies perception, cognition, and motor output. Applying patterned two-photon glutamate uncaging, we found that single dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons exhibit sensitivity to the sequence of synaptic activation. This sensitivity is encoded both by local dendritic calcium signals and by somatic depolarization, leading to sequence-selective spike output. The mechanism involves dendritic impedance gradients and nonlinear synaptic NMDA receptor activation and is generalizable to dendrites in different neuronal types. This enables discrimination of patterns delivered to a single dendrite, as well as patterns distributed randomly across the dendritic tree. Pyramidal cell dendrites can thus act as processing compartments for detection of synaptic sequences, implementing a fundamental cortical computation.},

	abstract = {The second messenger inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) releases Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ stores by activating specific receptors on the membranes of these stores. In many cells, InsP3 is a global signalling molecule that liberates Ca2+ throughout thecytoplasm,. However, in neurons the situation might be different,, because synaptic activity may produce InsP3 at discrete locations. Here we characterize InsP3 signalling in postsynaptic cerebellar Purkinje neurons, which have a high level of InsP3 receptors. We find that repetitive activation of the synapse between parallel fibres and Purkinje cells causes InsP3-mediated Ca2+ release in the Purkinje cells. This Ca2+ release is restricted to individual postsynaptic spines, where both metabotropic glutamate receptors, and InsP3 receptors are located, or to multiple spines and adjacent dendritic shafts. Focal photolysis of caged InsP3 (ref. 8) in Purkinje cell dendrites also produces Ca2+ signals that spread only a few micrometres from the site of InsP3 production. Uncaged InsP3 produces a long-lasting depression of parallel-fibre synaptic transmission that is limited to synapses where the Ca2+ concentration is raised. Thus, in Purkinje cells InP3 acts within a restricted spatial range that allows it to regulate the function of local groups of parallel-fibre synapses.},

	abstract = {The activity of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) plays an integral role in regulating synaptic development and plasticity. We designed a live-cell-imaging approach to monitor an activity-dependent clustering of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-CaMKII holoenzymes, termed self-association, a process that we hypothesize contributes to the translocation of CaMKII to synaptic and nonsynaptic sites in activated neurons. We show that GFP-CaMKII self-association in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells requires a catalytic domain and multimeric structure, requires Ca2+ stimulation and a functional Ca2+/CaM-binding domain, is regulated by cellular pH and Thr286 autophosphorylation, and has variable rates of dissociation depending on Ca2+ levels. Furthermore, we show that the same rules that govern CaMKII self-association in HEK293 cells apply for extrasynaptic and postsynaptic translocation of GFP-CaMKII in hippocampal neurons. Our data support a novel mechanism for targeting CaMKII to postsynaptic sites after neuronal activation. As such, CaMKII may form a scaffold that, in combination with other synaptic proteins, recruits and localizes additional proteins to the postsynaptic density. We discuss the potential function of CaMKII self-association as a tag of synaptic activity.},

LTP induction results in calcium entry, which activates calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). CaMKII subsequently translocates to the synapse, where it binds to NMDA-type glutamate receptors and produces potentiation by phosphorylating principal and auxiliary subunits of AMPA-type glutamate receptors. These processes are all localized to stimulated spines and account for the synapse-specificity of LTP. In the later stages of LTP, CaMKII has a structural role in enlarging and strengthening the synapse.},

Calcium decay kinetics are controlled by slower diffusion through the spine neck and by spine calcium pumps. Calcium release occurs in spines, although its role is controversial. Finally, the endogenous calcium buffers in spines remain unknown. Thus, spines are calcium compartments because of their morphologies and local influx and extrusion mechanisms. These studies highlight the richness and heterogeneity of pathways that regulate calcium accumulations in spines and the close relationship between the morphology and function of the spine.},

	abstract = {Engineered systems are often built of recurring circuit modules that carry out key functions. Transcription networks that regulate the responses of living cells were recently found to obey similar principles: they contain several biochemical wiring patterns, termed network motifs, which recur throughout the network. One of these motifs is the feed-forward loop (FFL). The FFL, a three-gene pattern, is composed of two input transcription factors, one of which regulates the other, both jointly regulating a target gene. The FFL has eight possible structural types, because each of the three interactions in the FFL can be activating or repressing. Here, we theoretically analyze the functions of these eight structural types. We find that four of the FFL types, termed incoherent FFLs, act as sign-sensitive accelerators: they speed up the response time of the target gene expression following stimulus steps in one direction (e.g., off to on) but not in the other direction (on to off). The other four types, coherent FFLs, act as sign-sensitive delays. We find that some FFL types appear in transcription network databases much more frequently than others. In some cases, the rare FFL types have reduced functionality (responding to only one of their two input stimuli), which may partially explain why they are selected against. Additional features, such as pulse generation and cooperativity, are discussed. This study defines the function of one of the most significant recurring circuit elements in transcription networks.},

Feedback can result in bistable behavior with discrete steady-state activities, well-defined input thresholds for transition between states and prolonged signal output, and signal modulation in response to transient stimuli.

	abstract = {How do fleeting signals passing through the neurons of our brains become memories that can last for years or even decades? An enzyme called CaMKII is known to have an important role in the formation of memories. CaMKII adds phosphate groups to proteins—a process that is called phosphorylation—and is itself activated when calcium levels increase inside the neurons where the enzyme is found. Individual CaMKII proteins bind together in groups of 12 to form a ‘holoenzyme’. When one of the 12 subunits is activated by calcium, it can phosphorylate the other subunits in the same holoenzyme. Once this happens, the activation of CaMKII can continue after the initial rise in calcium has ceased, and this effect is thought to be involved in the formation of long-term memories. 30 years ago, Francis Crick—famous for his role in the discovery of the double helix—proposed that memory formation might involve ‘memory-storage molecules’ passing an activated state to unactivated molecules, and John Lisman later suggested that CaMKII could fulfil this role by swapping subunits of holoenzymes between activated and unactivated ones. Now, Stratton, Lee et al. have tested whether CaMKII can exchange subunits by using advanced microscopy to track single molecules of CaMKII labelled with fluorescent markers. This revealed that activation can cause CaMKII subunits repeatedly to mix between holoenzymes—and this only happens once a first holoenzyme has been activated. Subunits of CaMKII join together via a central ‘hub’ region, but when a subunit is activated, the phosphorylated segment may interact with the hub. This weakens the connections between the subunits, thereby making it easier for subunits to exchange between holoenzymes. This process provides a mechanism by which a level of activated CaMKII can be maintained, even if some subunits become degraded and long after the disappearance of the initial activation signal.},

We show that synaptic strength scales with the number of connections K as {\textasciitilde} , close to the ideal theoretical value. Using optogenetic techniques, we delivered spatiotemporally patterned stimuli to neurons and confirmed key theoretical predictions: E–I balance is maintained, active decorrelation occurs and the spiking correlation increases with firing rate. Moreover, the trial-to-trial response variability decreased during stimulation, as observed in vivo. These results—obtained in generic cultures, predicted by theory and observed in the intact brain—suggest that the synaptic scaling rule and resultant dynamics are emergent properties of networks in general.},

Surprisingly, it remains unclear whether activity modifies the strength of individual synapses in a digital (all-or-none) or analog (graded) manner. Here we characterize step-like all-or-none transitions from baseline synaptic transmission to potentiated states following protocols for inducing potentiation at putative single CA3-CA1 synaptic connections. Individual synapses appear to have all-or-none potentiation indicative of highly cooperative processes but different thresholds for undergoing potentiation. These results raise the possibility that some forms of synaptic memory may be stored in a digital manner in the brain.},

	abstract = {Cells called neurons allow information to travel quickly around the body so that we can rapidly respond to any changes that we sense in our environment. This includes non-conscious reactions, such as the knee-jerk reflex in humans. Reflexes and other behaviors can be influenced by long-term memory, and it is thought that long-term memory is stored by changes in the synapses that connect neurons to each other. The reflexes of a sea slug known as Aplysia are often used to study memory because it has a simple nervous system in which individual sensory neurons (which detect changes) only form synapses with single motor neurons (which control muscles). Chen et al. have now studied whether long-term memory is actually stored in these synapses. Sensory neurons and motor neurons removed from Aplysia were grown together in Petri dishes and allowed to form synapses. Next, the cells were treated with the hormone serotonin, which promotes long-term memory by, in part, causing the neurons to grow more synapses. Afterwards, the cells were given treatments that disrupted long-term memory and also reversed the synaptic growth caused by serotonin. However, it was not only new synapses that retracted: some synapses that had existed before the serotonin treatment were also lost. This apparently random loss of synapses suggests that the memory was not stored in specific synapses. Moreover, long-term memory could be restored after these treatments, which supports that idea that memory does not depend on synapses between the neurons being maintained. This work offers hope that it might be possible to develop treatments that help to restore long-term memory in people suffering from Alzheimer's disease and other conditions that affect long-term memory.},

In its most general form, the synaptic plasticity and memory hypothesis states that “activity-dependent synaptic plasticity is induced at appropriate synapses during memory formation and is both necessary and sufficient for the information storage underlying the type of memory mediated by the brain area in which that plasticity is observed.” We outline a set of criteria by which this hypothesis can be judged and describe a range of experimental strategies used to investigate it. We review both classical and newly discovered properties of synaptic plasticity and stress the importance of the neural architecture and synaptic learning rules of the network in which it is embedded. The greater part of the article focuses on types of memory mediated by the hippocampus, amygdala, and cortex. We conclude that a wealth of data supports the notion that synaptic plasticity is necessary for learning and memory, but that little data currently supports the notion of sufficiency.},

	abstract = {Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is known to play a key role during induction of long-term potentiation (LTP). Given the dependence of LTP on the frequency of synaptic activation, several previous modeling efforts have proposed that biochemical properties of CaMKII itself might be in part responsible for this dependence. Recently, De Koninck and Schulman (1998) have provided direct experimental evidence that the enzyme itself is sensitive to the frequency of Ca(2+) activation. Here we demonstrate the ability of a detailed biophysical model constructed solely on enzyme kinetics of purified proteins to generate the frequency sensitivity demonstrated by De Koninck and Schulman. Quantitative analysis of the model reveals that this frequency sensitivity is provided by a mechanism different from those previously postulated. This analysis leads to specific predictions concerning the effects of mutations on this process. We further employ the model to examine the asymptotic behavior of CaMKII-phosphatase system during longer simulated periods of stimulation. The analyses of the model suggest that the transient and asymptotic frequency sensitivity of this enzyme are dependent on different biochemical mechanisms. These results may be applicable to Ca(2+)/calmodulin signaling pathways in general.},

We construct asymptotically optimal (i.e., distortion-minimizing) line embeddings for these metrics and prove their optimality via suitable lower bound arguments. It appears that even such specialized metrics require nontrivial constructions and proofs of optimality require sophisticated combinatorial arguments.

Key aspects of the expression of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) remain unresolved despite decades of investigation. Alterations in postsynaptic glutamate receptors are believed to contribute to the expression of various forms of LTP and LTD, but the relative importance of presynaptic mechanisms is controversial. In addition, while aggregate synaptic input to a cell can undergo sequential and graded (incremental) LTP and LTD, it has been suggested that individual synapses may only support binary changes between initial and modified levels of strength. We have addressed these issues by combining electrophysiological methods with two-photon optical quantal analysis of plasticity at individual active (non-silent) Schaffer collateral synapses on CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute slices of hippocampus from adolescent rats. We find that these synapses sustain graded, bidirectional long-term plasticity. Remarkably, changes in potency are small and insignificant; long-term plasticity at these synapses is expressed overwhelmingly via presynaptic changes in reliability of transmitter release.},

Synaptic NMDA receptor activity can induce both stargazin phosphorylation, via activation of CaMKII and PKC, and stargazin dephosphorylation, by activation of PP1 downstream of PP2B. At hippocampal synapses, long-term potentiation and long-term depression require stargazin phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, respectively.

	doi = {10.1098/rstb.2015.0419},
	abstract = {From the very dawn of biological evolution, ATP was selected as a multipurpose energy-storing molecule. Metabolism of ATP required intracellular free Ca(2+) to be set at exceedingly low concentrations, which in turn provided the background for the role of Ca(2+) as a universal signalling molecule. The early-eukaryote life forms also evolved functional compartmentalization and vesicle trafficking, which used Ca(2+) as a universal signalling ion; similarly, Ca(2+) is needed for regulation of ciliary and flagellar beat, amoeboid movement, intracellular transport, as well as of numerous metabolic processes. Thus, during evolution, exploitation of atmospheric oxygen and increasingly efficient ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation by bacterial endosymbionts were a first step for the emergence of complex eukaryotic cells. Simultaneously, Ca(2+) started to be exploited for short-range signalling, despite restrictions by the preset phosphate-based energy metabolism, when both phosphates and Ca(2+) interfere with each other because of the low solubility of calcium phosphates. The need to keep cytosolic Ca(2+) low forced cells to restrict Ca(2+) signals in space and time and to develop energetically favourable Ca(2+) signalling and Ca(2+) microdomains. These steps in tandem dominated further evolution. The ATP molecule (often released by Ca(2+)-regulated exocytosis) rapidly grew to be the universal chemical messenger for intercellular communication; ATP effects are mediated by an extended family of purinoceptors often linked to Ca(2+) signalling. Similar to atmospheric oxygen, Ca(2+) must have been reverted from a deleterious agent to a most useful (intra- and extracellular) signalling molecule. Invention of intracellular trafficking further increased the role for Ca(2+) homeostasis that became critical for regulation of cell survival and cell death. Several mutually interdependent effects of Ca(2+) and ATP have been exploited in evolution, thus turning an originally unholy alliance into a fascinating success story.This article is part of the themed issue 'Evolution brings Ca(2+) and ATP together to control life and death'.},

Further, there is no consensus on how the search for one should be refocussed so as to make it more fruitful. In this short piece we observe that research in computer science over the last several decades has shown that significant computational phenomena need to circumvent significant inherent quantitative impediments, such as of computational complexity. We argue that computational neuroscience has to be informed by the same quantitative concerns for it to succeed. It is conceivable that the brain is the one computation that does not need to circumvent any such obstacles, but if that were the case then quantitatively plausible theories of cortex would now surely abound and be driving experimental investigations.},

	abstract = {Molecular switches have been implicated in the storage of information in biological systems. For small structures such as synapses, these switches are composed of only a few molecules and stochastic fluctuations are therefore of importance. Such fluctuations could potentially lead to spontaneous switch reset that would limit the lifetime of information storage. We have analyzed a model of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) switch implicated in long-term memory in the nervous system. The bistability of this switch arises from autocatalytic autophosphorylation of CaMKII, a reaction that is countered by a saturable phosphatase-1-mediated dephosphorylation. We sought to understand the factors that control switch stability and to determine the functional relationship between stability and the number of molecules involved. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we found that the lifetime of states of the switch increase exponentially with the number of CaMKII holoenzymes. Switch stability requires a balance between the kinase and phosphatase rates, and the kinase rate must remain high relative to the rate of protein turnover. Thus, a critical limit on switch stability is set by the observed turnover rate (one per 30 h on average). Our computational results show that, depending on the timescale of fluctuations in enzyme numbers, for a switch composed of about 15 CaMKII holoenzymes, the stable persistent activation can span from a few years to a human lifetime.},

	abstract = {Recordings of brain activity in moving rats have found neurons that fire when the rat is at specific locations. These neurons are known as grid cells because their activity produces a grid-like pattern. A separate group of neurons, called head direction cells, represents the rat’s facing direction. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that have tracked brain activity in humans as they navigate virtual environments have found similar grid-like and direction-related responses. A recent study showed grid-like responses even if the people being studied just imagined moving around an arena while lying still. Theoretical work suggests that spatially tuned cells might generally be important for our ability to imagine and simulate future events. However, it is not clear whether these location- and direction-responsive cells are active when people do not visualize themselves moving. Bellmund et al. used fMRI to track brain activity in volunteers as they imagined different views in a virtual reality city. Before the fMRI experiment, the volunteers completed extensive training where they learned the layout of the city and the names of its buildings. Then, during the fMRI experiment, the volunteers had to imagine themselves standing in front of certain buildings and facing different directions. Crucially, they did not imagine themselves moving between these buildings. By using representational similarity analysis, which compares patterns of brain activity, Bellmund et al. could distinguish between the directions the volunteers were imagining. Activity patterns in the parahippocampal gyrus (a brain region known to be important for navigation) were more similar when participants were imagining similar directions. The fMRI results also show grid-like responses in a brain area called entorhinal cortex, which is known to contain grid cells. While participants were imagining, this region exhibited activity patterns with a six-fold symmetry, as Bellmund et al. predicted from the characteristic firing patterns of grid cells. The findings presented by Bellmund et al. provide evidence that suggests that grid cells are involved in planning how to navigate, and so support previous theoretical assumptions. The computations of these cells might contribute to other kinds of thinking too, such as remembering the past or imagining future events.},

	abstract = {The induction of late long-term potentiation (L-LTP) involves complex interactions among second-messenger cascades. To gain insights into these interactions, a mathematical model was developed for L-LTP induction in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The differential equation-based model represents actions of protein kinase A (PKA), MAP kinase (MAPK), and CaM kinase II (CAMKII) in the vicinity of the synapse, and activation of transcription by CaM kinase IV (CAMKIV) and MAPK. L-LTP is represented by increases in a synaptic weight. Simulations suggest that steep, supralinear stimulus-response relationships between stimuli (e.g., elevations in [Ca2+]) and kinase activation are essential for translating brief stimuli into long-lasting gene activation and synaptic weight increases. Convergence of multiple kinase activities to induce L-LTP helps to generate a threshold whereby the amount of L-LTP varies steeply with the number of brief (tetanic) electrical stimuli. The model simulates tetanic, θ-burst, pairing-induced, and chemical L-LTP, as well as L-LTP due to synaptic tagging. The model also simulates inhibition of L-LTP by inhibition of MAPK, CAMKII, PKA, or CAMKIV. The model predicts results of experiments to delineate mechanisms underlying L-LTP induction and expression. For example, the cAMP antagonist RpcAMPs, which inhibits L-LTP induction, is predicted to inhibit ERK activation. The model also appears useful to clarify similarities and differences between hippocampal L-LTP and long-term synaptic strengthening in other systems.},

	abstract = {In the adult mammalian brain, more than 250 protein kinases are expressed, but only a few of these kinases are currently known to enable learning and memory. Based on this information it appears that learning and memory-related kinases either impact on synaptic transmission by altering ion channel properties or ion channel density, or regulate gene expression and protein synthesis causing structural changes at existing synapses as well as synaptogenesis. Here, we review the roles of these kinases in short-term memory formation, memory consolidation, memory storage, retrieval, reconsolidation, and extinction. Specifically, we discuss the roles of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), the calcium/calmodulin kinase cascade, extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG), the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, and protein kinase M ζ (PKMζ). Although these kinases are important for learning and memory processes, much remains to be learned as to how they act. Therefore, it will be important to identify and characterize the critical phosphorylation substrates so that a sophisticated understanding of learning and memory processes will be achieved. This will also allow for a systematic analysis of dysfunctional kinase activity in mental disorders.},

There is an enormous and largely hidden layer of molecular computation, and many aspects of neuronal plasticity have been modeled in chemical terms. Memorable events impinge on a neuron as special input patterns, and the neuron has to decide if it should ‘remember’ this event. This pattern-decoding decision is mediated by kinase cascades and signaling networks over millisecond to hour-long timescales. The process of cellular memory itself is rooted in molecular changes that give rise to life-long, stable physiological changes. Modeling studies show how cascades of synaptic molecular switches can achieve this, despite stochasticity and molecular turnover. Such biochemically detailed models form a valuable conceptual framework to assimilate the complexities of chemical signaling in neuronal computation.},

CDF of L-type Ca2+ channels (Cav1.2) contributes to the positive force–frequency effect in the heart and is believed to involve the activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII). How CaMKII is activated and what its substrates are have not yet been determined. We show that the pore-forming subunit α1C (Cavα1.2) is a CaMKII substrate and that CaMKII interaction with the COOH terminus of α1C is essential for CDF of L-type channels. Ca2+ influx triggers distinct features of CaMKII targeting and activity. After Ca2+-induced targeting to α1C, CaMKII becomes tightly tethered to the channel, even after calcium returns to normal levels. In contrast, activity of the tethered CaMKII remains fully Ca2+/CaM dependent, explaining its ability to operate as a calcium spike frequency detector. These findings clarify the molecular basis of CDF and demonstrate a novel enzymatic mechanism by which ion channel gating can be modulated by activity.},

High fidelity synaptic communication between subsets of neurons in specific circuits is required for most human behaviors, and is often disrupted in neuropsychiatric disorders. The presynaptic axon terminals of one neuron release neurotransmitters that activate receptors on multiple postsynaptic neuron targets to induce electrical and chemical responses. Typically, postsynaptic neurons integrate signals from multiple presynaptic neurons at thousands of synaptic inputs to control downstream communication to the next neuron in the circuit. Importantly, the strength (or efficiency) of signal transmission at each synapse can be modulated on time scales ranging up to the lifetime of the organism. This “synaptic plasticity” leads to changes in overall neuronal circuit activity, resulting in behavioral modifications.

Scaffolding proteins containing multiple protein interaction motifs are thought to provide the framework of the PSD through their interactions with both membrane proteins and the cytoplasmic proteins. Among the cytoplasmic signaling molecules, calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II stands out as a major component of the PSD and its dynamic translocation to the PSD in response to neuronal activity is crucial in synaptic signal transduction. Recent advancements in molecular biological, structural and electrophysiological techniques have enabled us to directly measure the number, distribution and interactions of PSD molecules with high sensitivity and precision. In this review, I describe the structure and molecular composition of the PSD as well as the molecular interactions between the major constituents.

To understand the computational principles behind these intricate networks of interactions we construct a broad class of synaptic models that efficiently harnesses biological complexity to preserve numerous memories. The memory capacity scales almost linearly with the number of synapses, which is a substantial improvement over the square root scaling of previous models. This was achieved by combining multiple dynamical processes that initially store memories in fast variables and then progressively transfer them to slower variables. Importantly, the interactions between fast and slow variables are bidirectional. The proposed models are robust to parameter perturbations and can explain several properties of biological memory, including delayed expression of synaptic modifications, metaplasticity, and spacing effects.},

	abstract = {Memories maintained in patterns of synaptic connectivity are rapidly overwritten and destroyed by ongoing plasticity related to the storage of new memories. Short memory lifetimes arise from the bounds that must be imposed on synaptic efficacy in any realistic model. We explored whether memory performance can be improved by allowing synapses to traverse a large number of states before reaching their bounds, or by changing the way these bounds are imposed. In the case of hard bounds, memory lifetimes grow proportional to the square of the number of synaptic states, but only if potentiation and depression are precisely balanced. Improved performance can be obtained without fine tuning by imposing soft bounds, but this improvement is only linear with respect to the number of synaptic states. We explored several other possibilities and conclude that improving memory performance requires a more radical modification of the standard model of memory storage.},

The mechanisms that instruct the assembly of fine-scale features of synaptic connectivity in neural circuits are only beginning to be understood. Using whole-cell electrophysiology, two-photon calcium imaging, and glutamate uncaging in hippocampal slices, we discovered a functional coupling between NMDA receptor activation and ryanodine-sensitive intracellular calcium release that dominates the spatiotemporal dynamics of activity-dependent calcium signals during synaptogenesis. This developmentally regulated calcium amplification mechanism was tuned to detect and bind spatially clustered and temporally correlated synaptic inputs and enacted a local cooperative plasticity rule between coactive neighboring synapses. Consistent with the hypothesis that synapse maturation is spatially regulated, we observed clustering of synaptic weights in developing dendritic arbors. These results reveal developmental features of NMDA receptor-dependent calcium dynamics and local plasticity rules that are suited to spatially guide synaptic connectivity patterns in emerging neural networks.},

	abstract = {The demands of modern society means that millions of people do not get sufficient sleep on a daily basis. Sleep deprivation, even if only for brief periods, can impair learning and memory. In many cases, this impairment appears to be related to changes in the activity of a brain region called the hippocampus. However, the exact processes responsible for producing the effects of sleep deprivation remain unclear. During learning or forming a new memory, the connections between the relevant neurons in the brain change. Havekes et al. found that depriving mice of sleep for just five hours dramatically reduced the connectivity between neurons in the hippocampus. This reduction is caused by the increased activity of cofilin, a protein that breaks down the actin filaments that shape the connections between neurons. Havekes et al. then used a virus to introduce an inactive version of cofilin into hippocampal neurons to suppress the activity of the naturally present cofilin. This manipulation prevented both the loss of the connections between neurons and the memory deficits normally associated with sleep deprivation. Havekes et al. also found that recovery sleep leads to the re-wiring of neurons in the hippocampus. Future studies are now needed to determine how the neurons are able to re-wire themselves during recovery sleep.},

We imaged [Ca2+] transients mediated by synaptically activated NMDA receptors (NMDA-Rs) in individual spines in rat brain slices. We show that Ca2+ influx through single NMDA-Rs can be reliably detected, allowing us to estimate the number of receptors opening after synaptic transmission. This number is small: at the peak of the synaptic response, less than one NMDA-R is open, on average. Therefore, stochastic interactions between transmitter and receptor contribute substantially to synaptic noise, and glutamate occupies a small fraction of receptors. The number of receptors opening did not scale with spine volume, and smaller spines experience larger [Ca2+] transients during synaptic transmission. Our measurements further demonstrate that optical recordings can be used to study single receptors in intact systems.},

	abstract = {Autophosphorylation of α-Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) at Thr-286 generates Ca2+-independent activity that outlasts the initial Ca2+ stimulus. Previous studies suggested that this autophosphorylation occurs between subunits within each CaM kinase II holoenzyme. However, electron microscopy studies have questioned this mechanism because a large distance separates a kinase domain from its neighboring subunit. Moreover, the recently discovered ability of CaM kinase II holoenzymes to self-associate has raised questions about data interpretation in previous investigations of autophosphorylation. In this work, we characterize the mechanism of CaM kinase II autophosphorylation. To eliminate ambiguity arising from kinase aggregation, we used dynamic light scattering to establish the monodispersity of all enzyme solutions. We then found using chemical quenched flow kinetics that the autophosphorylation rate was independent of the CaM kinase II concentration, results corroborating intraholoenzyme activation. Experiments with a monomeric CaM kinase II showed that phosphorylation of this construct is intermolecular, supporting intersubunit phosphorylation within a holoenzyme. The autophosphorylation rate at 30 °C was ∼12 s−1, more than 10-fold faster than past estimates. The ability of CaM kinase II to autophosphorylate through an intraholoenzyme, intersubunit mechanism is likely central to its functions of decoding Ca2+ spike frequency and providing a sustained response to Ca2+ signals.},

We present the crystal structure of an autoinhibited full-length human CaMKII holoenzyme, revealing an unexpected compact arrangement of kinase domains docked against a central hub, with the calmodulin-binding sites completely inaccessible. We show that this compact docking is important for the autoinhibition of the kinase domains and for setting the calcium response of the holoenzyme. Comparison of CaMKII isoforms, which differ in the length of the linker between the kinase domain and the hub, demonstrates that these interactions can be strengthened or weakened by changes in linker length. This equilibrium between autoinhibited states provides a simple mechanism for tuning the calcium response without changes in either the hub or the kinase domains.},

In this study, we seek to find the rules shaping the stationary distribution of synaptic efficacies in the cortex. To address this question, we combined chronic imaging of hundreds of spines in the auditory cortex of mice in vivo over weeks with modeling techniques to quantitatively study the dynamics of spines, the morphological correlates of excitatory synapses in the neocortex. We found that the stationary distribution of spine sizes of individual neurons can be exceptionally well described by a log-normal function. We furthermore show that spines exhibit substantial volatility in their sizes at timescales that range from days to months. Interestingly, the magnitude of changes in spine sizes is proportional to the size of the spine. Such multiplicative dynamics are in contrast with conventional models of synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory, which typically assume additive dynamics. Moreover, we show that the ongoing dynamics of spine sizes can be captured by a simple phenomenological model that operates at two timescales of days and months. This model converges to a log-normal distribution, bridging the gap between synaptic dynamics and the stationary distribution of synaptic efficacies.},

	abstract = {Memory storage involves activity-dependent strengthening of synaptic transmission, a process termed long-term potentiation (LTP). The late phase of LTP is thought to encode long-term memory and involves structural processes that enlarge the synapse. Hence, understanding how synapse size is graded provides fundamental information about the information storage capability of synapses. Recent work using electron microscopy (EM) to quantify synapse dimensions has suggested that synapses may structurally encode as many as 26 functionally distinct states, which correspond to a series of proportionally spaced synapse sizes. Other recent evidence using super-resolution microscopy has revealed that synapses are composed of stereotyped nanoclusters of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors and scaffolding proteins; furthermore, synapse size varies linearly with the number of nanoclusters. Here we have sought to develop a model of synapse structure and growth that is consistent with both the EM and super-resolution data. We argue that synapses are composed of modules consisting of matrix material and potentially one nanocluster. LTP induction can add a trans-synaptic nanocluster to a module, thereby converting a silent module to an AMPA functional module. LTP can also add modules by a linear process, thereby producing an approximately 10-fold gradation in synapse size and strength.

In the current study, we examined the possibility that the spontaneous microscopic dynamics exhibited by synaptic molecules can explain the macroscopic size fluctuations of individual synapses and the statistical properties of synaptic populations. We present a mesoscopic model, which ties the two levels. Its basic premise is that synaptic size fluctuations reflect cooperative assimilation and removal of molecules at a patch of postsynaptic membrane. The introduction of cooperativity to both assimilation and removal in a stochastic biophysical model of these processes, gives rise to features qualitatively similar to those measured experimentally: nanoclusters of synaptic scaffolds, fluctuations in synaptic sizes, skewed, stable size distributions and their scaling in response to perturbations. Our model thus points to the potentially fundamental role of cooperativity in dictating synaptic remodeling dynamics and offers a conceptual understanding of these dynamics in terms of central microscopic features and processes.},

	abstract = {CaMKII is an abundant synaptic protein strongly implicated in plasticity. Overexpression of autonomous (T286D) CaMKII in CA1 hippocampal cells enhances synaptic strength if T305/T306 sites are not phosphorylated, but decreases synaptic strength if they are phosphorylated. It has generally been thought that spine size and synaptic strength covary; however, the ability of CaMKII and its various phosphorylation states to control spine size has not been previously examined. Using a unique method that allows the effects of overexpressed protein to be monitored over time, we found that all autonomous forms of CaMKII increase spine size. Thus, for instance, the T286D/T305D/T306D form increases spine size but decreases synaptic strength. Further evidence for such dissociation is provided by experiments with the T286D form that has been made catalytically dead. This form fails to enhance synaptic strength but increases spine size, presumably by a structural process. Thus very different mechanisms govern how CaMKII affects spine structure and synaptic function.},

In the current study, we examined the possibility that the spontaneous microscopic dynamics exhibited by synaptic molecules can explain the macroscopic size fluctuations of individual synapses and the statistical properties of synaptic populations. We present a mesoscopic model, which ties the two levels. Its basic premise is that synaptic size fluctuations reflect cooperative assimilation and removal of molecules at a patch of postsynaptic membrane. The introduction of cooperativity to both assimilation and removal in a stochastic biophysical model of these processes, gives rise to features qualitatively similar to those measured experimentally: nanoclusters of synaptic scaffolds, fluctuations in synaptic sizes, skewed, stable size distributions and their scaling in response to perturbations. Our model thus points to the potentially fundamental role of cooperativity in dictating synaptic remodeling dynamics and offers a conceptual understanding of these dynamics in terms of central microscopic features and processes.},

It is a useful technique in cases where an important class of data is under-represented in the training set. This means that the performance of the network will be poor for those classes. In some circumstances, such as medical data and fault detection, it is often precisely the class that is under-represented in the data, the disease or potential fault, that the network should detect. In novelty detection systems the network is trained only on the negative examples where that class is not present, and then detects inputs that do not fits into the model that it has acquired, that it, members of the novel class. This paper reviews the literature on novelty detection in neural networks and other machine learning techniques, as well as providing brief overviews of the related topics of statistical outlier detection and novelty detection in biological organisms. 1},

However, the simplex rules potentially can induce excessive excitation/inhibition, even collapse of neural activities, because they neglect the properties of long-term homeostasis involved in the frameworks of realistic neural networks. Here, we develop organic CuPc-based memristors of which excitatory and inhibitory conductivities can implement both Hebbian rules and homeostatic plasticity, complementary to Hebbian patterns and conductive to the long-term homeostasis. In another adaptive situation for homeostasis, in thicker samples, the overall excitement under periodic moderate stimuli tends to decrease and be recovered under intense inputs. Interestingly, the prototypes can be equipped with bio-inspired habituation and sensitization functions outperforming the conventional simplified algorithms. They mutually regulate each other to obtain the homeostasis. Therefore, we develop a novel versatile memristor with advanced synaptic homeostasis for comprehensive neural functions.},

In this study we compare SSA across different populations of neurons in the inferior colliculus (IC) of the rat and show that a subclass of neurons with rapid and pronounced SSA respond selectively to novel sounds. These neurons, located in the dorsal and external cortex of the IC, fail to respond to multiple repetitions of a sound but briefly recover their excitability when some stimulus parameter is changed.

In the present study, neuronal activity in the amygdala (AM) was recorded from alert monkeys while they performed tasks leading to the presentation of rewarding or aversive stimuli. Of 585 AM neurons tested, 312 (53.3\%) responded to at least one stimulus in one or more of 5 major groups: 40 vision related, 26 audition related, 41 ingestion related, 117 multimodal, and 14 selective. Ingestion-related neurons were subdivided according to their responses to other stimuli: oral sensory, oral sensory plus vision, and oral sensory plus audition. Depending upon their responsiveness to the affective significance of the stimuli, neurons in the vision- and audition-related categories were divided into 2 subclasses: vis-I (26/40), vis-II (14/40), aud-I (8/26), and aud- II (18/26). All 4 subtypes usually responded to unfamiliar stimuli but seldom responded to neutral familiar stimuli. Types vis-I and aud-I responded to both positive and negative familiar stimuli. Types vis-II and aud-II responded to certain familiar negative stimuli but not to familiar positive stimuli. In vis-I neurons, responses were stronger for palatable foods than for less palatable foods. No neurons within vision-related, audition-related, and multimodal categories responded solely to positive or to negative stimuli. Of the 27 oral sensory neurons 9 were tested with saline or salted food, and 8 responded to normally aversive oral sensory stimuli in the same manner as they did to normal food or liquid (water or juice). In contrast to oral sensory neurons, all responses of 4 oral sensory-plus-vision and all of 4 selective neurons tested, as well as bar pressing behavior, were modulated by altering the affective significance of the food. These results suggest that the AM is one of the candidates for stimulus- affective association based on associative learning and memory.},

Despite significant progress in the field, it is still computationally prohibitive to simulate systems involving many reactants or complex geometries using a microscopic framework that includes the finest length and time scales of diffusion-limited molecular interactions. For this reason, spatially or temporally discretized simulations schemes are commonly used when modeling intracellular reaction networks. The challenge in defining such coarse-grained models is to calculate the correct probabilities of reaction given the microscopic parameters and the uncertainty in the molecular positions introduced by the spatial or temporal discretization. In this paper we have solved this problem for the spatially discretized Reaction-Diffusion Master Equation; this enables a seamless and physically consistent transition from the microscopic to the macroscopic frameworks of reaction-diffusion kinetics. We exemplify the use of the methods by showing that a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation motif, commonly observed in eukaryotic signaling pathways, is predicted to display fluctuations that depend on the geometry of the system.},

	abstract = {Cross-diffusion, the phenomenon in which a gradient in the concentration of one species induces a flux of another chemical species, has generally been neglected in the study of reaction–diffusion systems. We summarize experiments that demonstrate that cross-diffusion coefficients can be quite significant, even exceeding “normal,” diagonal diffusion coefficients in magnitude in systems that involve ions, micelles, complex formation, excluded volume effects (e.g., surface or polymer reactions) and other phenomena commonly encountered in situations of interest to chemists. We then demonstrate with a series of model calculations that cross-diffusion can lead to spatial and spatiotemporal pattern formation, even in relatively simple systems. We also show that, in the absence of cross-diffusion among the reacting species, introduction of a nonreactive species that induces appropriate cross-diffusive fluxes with reactive species can lead to pattern formation.},

Stochastic implementations of the conventional H/H2 RD model and the poly H/H2 RD model are realized, and their equivalence to continuum implementations are investigated for large area devices. Impact of dimensionality (1D, 2D, 3D) and device size (W, L) are explored for stochastic implementation. Stochastic simulations for small area devices using the poly H/H2 RD model show long term 1/6 power law time exponent during stress. A comprehensive framework consisting of H/H2 RD model for NIT along with empirical models for hole trapping (NHT) and bulk trap generation (NOT) is able to predict experimental data for a wide variety of large area devices for different experimental conditions. Variation of small area device degradation has been simulated and compared to experimental results.},

Moreover, many psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders are related to dysfunction of these neuromodulatory systems. Neurons of the brainstem nucleus locus coeruleus are the sole source of noradrenaline, a neuromodulator that has a key role in all of these forebrain activities. Elucidating the factors that control the activity of these neurons and the effect of noradrenaline in target regions is key to understanding how the brain allocates attention and apprehends the environment to select, store and retrieve information for generating adaptive behaviour.},

	url = {https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/33493470},
	abstract = {Bistability, in which a system has two stable states, is a common property of many dynamic systems. This thesis explores the properties of such systems across a range of length scales, from gene circuits to ecosystems. Cells often store memories of environmental stimuli using bistable gene circuits. High fidelity memory storage requires that a state has a long lifetime. However, an underappreciated aspect of stable memory is that the distance from a bifurcation could determine how sensitive a state is to perturbations in the extracellular environment. We predict that cell memory should become increasingly sensitive to perturbations near a bifurcation and test this idea in three different gene circuits: a toggle switch, the yeast galactose utilization network, and the E. coli lactose utilization network.

In a second study, we explore how the environmental context in which two species interact can influence their mode of interaction. Two species in nature often form reciprocally beneficial partnerships termed mutualisms, but in certain environmental regimes the species might shift to competing with one another for resources. This mutualism-competition transition has been understudied in experimental ecosystems. Using a synthetic yeast cross-feeding mutualism, we modulate the degree to which two partners rely on each other by supplementing the cells with variable amounts of nutrients. Surprisingly, we find that as the amount of supplemented nutrients is increased, the system passes through eight qualitatively distinct dynamic regimes: extinction, obligatory mutualism, obligatory/facultative mutualism, facultative mutualism, parasitism, amensalism, competition, and competitive exclusion.

In a third study, we probe how population growth dynamics can influence the probability of evolutionary rescue. Natural populations frequently face harsh environments in which their death rate exceeds their birth rate and population size tends toward zero. In such scenarios, populations can either go extinct, migrate to a better habitat, or adapt to the harsh environment. Natural populations often exhibit an “Allee effect,” in which populations grow slowly at low density due to struggles with such behaviors as finding a mate or collective hunting. We hypothesize that the presence of an Allee effect could impede evolutionary rescue and confirm this hypothesis in a model laboratory yeast ecosystem.},

In nonlinear reactions we show that a steadystate Poisson distribution is achieved in small volumes, whereas in large volumes a non-Poissonian distribution is built up via the correlation. The spatial correlation function is calculated for two examples, one which exhibits an instability, the other which exhibits a second-order phase transition, and correlation length and correlation time are calculated and shown to become infinite as the critical point is approached. The critical exponents are found to be classical.},

In the RDME, space is partitioned by a mesh into a collection of voxels. There is an unanswered question as to how solutions depend on the mesh spacing. To have confidence in using the RDME to draw conclusions about biological systems, we would like to know that it approximates a reasonable physical model for appropriately chosen mesh spacings. This issue is investigated by studying the dependence on mesh spacing of solutions to the RDME in \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}\{3\}\$ for the bimolecular reaction \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{A\}+{\textbackslash}mathrm\{B\}{\textbackslash}to{\textbackslash}varnothing\$, with one molecule of species \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{A\}\$ and one molecule of species \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{B\}\$ present initially. We prove that in the continuum limit the molecules never react and simply diffuse relative to each other. Nevertheless, we show that the RDME with nonzero lattice spacing yields an asymptotic approximation to a specific spatially continuous diffusion limited reaction (SCDLR) model. We demonstrate that for realistic biological parameters it is possible to find mesh spacings such that the relative error between asymptotic approximations to the solutions of the RDME and the SCDLR models is less than one percent.},

In both cases, it is shown that the commonly used implementation of bimolecular reactions (i.e. the reactions of the form A + B → C or A + A → C ) might lead to incorrect results. Improvements of both SSAs are suggested which overcome the difficulties highlighted. In particular, a formula is presented for the smallest possible compartment size (lattice spacing) which can be correctly implemented in the first model.

Two of the three methods that will be discussed in detail have been previously reported in the literature; the two-regime method (TRM) and the compartment–placement method (CPM). The third method that is introduced and analysed in this paper is called the ghost cell method (GCM), since it works by constructing a “ghost cell” in which molecules can disappear and jump into the compartment-based simulation. Presented is a comparison of sources of error. The convergent properties of this error are studied as the time step Δt (for updating the molecular-based part of the model) approaches zero. It is found that the error behaviour depends on another fundamental computational parameter h, the compartment size in the mesoscopic part of the model. Two important limiting cases, which appear in applications, are considered:(i)Δt→0 and h is fixed;(ii)Δt→0 and h→0 such that Δt/h is fixed. The error for previously developed approaches (the TRM and CPM) converges to zero only in the limiting case (ii), but not in case (i). It is shown that the error of the GCM converges in the limiting case (i). Thus the GCM is superior to previous coupling techniques if the mesoscopic description is much coarser than the microscopic part of the model.},

The microscopic algorithm is extended to simulation on curved surfaces in order to model reaction and diffusion on membranes. The accuracy of the method on and near a spherical membrane is analyzed and evaluated in a numerical experiment. Two  biologically motivated examples are simulated in which the need for microscopic simulation of parts of the system arises for different reasons. First, we apply the method to a model of the phosphorylation reactions in a mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade where microscale methods are necessary to resolve fast rebinding events. Then a model is considered for transport of a species over a membrane coupled to reactions in the bulk. The new algorithm attains an accuracy similar to a full microscopic simulation by handling critical interactions on the microscale, but at a significantly reduced cost by using the mesoscale framework for most parts of the biological model.},

	abstract = {In mammalian excitatory neurons, dendritic spines are separated from dendrites by thin necks. Diffusion across the neck limits the chemical and electrical isolation of each spine. We found that spine/dendrite diffusional coupling is heterogeneous and uncovered a class of diffusionally isolated spines. The barrier to diffusion posed by the neck and the number of diffusionally isolated spines is bidirectionally regulated by neuronal activity. Furthermore, coincident synaptic activation and postsynaptic action potentials rapidly restrict diffusion across the neck. The regulation of diffusional coupling provides a possible mechanism for determining the amplitude of postsynaptic potentials and the accumulation of plasticity-inducing molecules within the spine head.
Neuronal activity regulates the diffusion of molecules between neuronal processes and their synapse supporting spines, suggesting a new form of synaptic regulation.

In August 2007, the authors of this review, who study habituation in a wide range of species and paradigms, met to discuss their work on habituation and to revisit and refine the characteristics of habituation. This review offers a re-evaluation of the characteristics of habituation in light of these discussions. We made substantial changes to only a few of the characteristics, usually to add new information and expand upon the description rather than to substantially alter the original point. One additional characteristic, relating to long-term habituation, was added. This article thus provides a modern summary of the characteristics defining habituation, and can serve as a convenient primer for those whose research involves stimulus repetition.},

Diffusion in biological systems is often modeled by a discrete space jump process in order to capture the inherent noise of biological systems, which becomes important in the low copy number regime. To model diffusion in the crowded cell environment efficiently, we compute the jump rates in this mesoscopic model from local first exit times, which account for the microscopic positions of the crowding molecules, while the diffusing molecules jump on a coarser Cartesian grid. We then extract a macroscopic description from the resulting jump rates, where the excluded volume effect is modeled by a diffusion equation with space-dependent diffusion coefficient. The crowding molecules can be of arbitrary shape and size, and numerical experiments demonstrate that those factors together with the size of the diffusing molecule play a crucial role on the magnitude of the decrease in diffusive motion. When correcting the reaction rates for the altered diffusion we can show that molecular crowding either enhances or inhibits chemical reactions depending on local fluctuations of the obstacle density.},

Furthermore, a reanalysis of Ebbinghaus's (1885) classic savings function showed that it, too, declines as a power function of time.

Memory formation is thought to change the strength of synaptic connections between neurons. However, direct measurements between neurons that participate in a learning process are difficult to obtain. Choi et al. developed the “dual-eGRASP” technique to identify synaptic connections between hippocampal CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells. This method could label two different sets of synapses so that their convergence on the same dendrites would be quantified. After contextual fear conditioning in mice, the number and size of spines were increased on CA1 engram cells receiving input from CA3 engram cells.
Science, this issue p. 430
Memory resides in engram cells distributed across the brain. However, the site-specific substrate within these engram cells remains theoretical, even though it is generally accepted that synaptic plasticity encodes memories. We developed the dual-eGRASP (green fluorescent protein reconstitution across synaptic partners) technique to examine synapses between engram cells to identify the specific neuronal site for memory storage. We found an increased number and size of spines on CA1 engram cells receiving input from CA3 engram cells. In contextual fear conditioning, this enhanced connectivity between engram cells encoded memory strength. CA3 engram to CA1 engram projections strongly occluded long-term potentiation. These results indicate that enhanced structural and functional connectivity between engram cells across two directly connected brain regions forms the synaptic correlate for memory formation.
Memory strength can be explained by enhanced structural and functional connectivity among engram neurons in mice.

SBGN consists of three complementary languages: process diagram, entity relationship diagram and activity flow diagram. Together they enable scientists to represent networks of biochemical interactions in a standard, unambiguous way.

	abstract = {High-frequency stimulation of lateral perforant path is accompanied by a heterosynaptic long-term depression (LTD) of medial perforant path synaptic responses in both the dentate gyrus and the CA3 region of the hippocampus. We reported previously that LTP induction at lateral perforant path-CA3 synapses is unaffected by NMDA antagonists. However, it is not known if heterosynaptic LTD that is observed in the CA3 region following lateral perforant path stimulation also is independent from NMDA receptors. We address this question in anesthetized adult rats using systemic administration of the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist CPP. Induction of lateral perforant path-CA3 LTP produced a sustained heterosynaptic depression of medial perforant path-CA3 responses. Systemic administration of CPP (10 mg/kg) was ineffective in blocking the induction of LTP at lateral perforant path-CA3 responses. However, heterosynaptic LTD of medial perforant path-CA3 responses was blocked completely by CPP. These data indicate that NMDA receptors are not required for the induction of lateral perforant path-CA3 LTP, but are involved in the induction of heterosynaptic LTD that accompanies lateral perforant path activity. The requirement for NMDA receptors for heterosynaptic LTD suggests one functional role of NMDA receptors at termination fields of the lateral perforant path.},

	abstract = {In many regions of the brain, including the mammalian cortex, the magnitude and direction of activity-dependent changes in synaptic strength depend on the frequency of presynaptic stimulation (synaptic plasticity), as well as the history of activity at those synapses (metaplasticity). We present a model of a molecular mechanism of bidirectional synaptic plasticity based on the observation that long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) and long-term synaptic depression (LTD) correlate with the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of sites on the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor subunit protein GluR1. The primary assumption of the model, for which there is wide experimental support, is that postsynaptic calcium concentration and consequent activation of calcium-dependent protein kinases and phosphatases are the triggers for the induction of LTP/LTD. As calcium influx through the n-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor plays a fundamental role in the induction of LTP/LTD, changes in the properties of NMDA receptor-mediated calcium influx will dramatically affect activity-dependent synaptic plasticity (metaplasticity). We demonstrate that experimentally observed metaplasticity can be accounted for by activity-dependent regulation of NMDA receptor subunit composition and function. Our model produces a frequency-dependent LTP/LTD curve with a sliding synaptic modification threshold similar to what has been proposed theoretically by Bienenstock, Cooper, and Munro and observed experimentally.},

Synapses store information by long-lasting modifications of their structure and molecular composition, but the precise chronology of these changes has not been studied at single-synapse resolution in real time. Here we describe the spatiotemporal reorganization of postsynaptic substructures during long-term potentiation (LTP) at individual dendritic spines. Proteins translocated to the spine in four distinct patterns through three sequential phases. In the initial phase, the actin cytoskeleton was rapidly remodeled while active cofilin was massively transported to the spine. In the stabilization phase, cofilin formed a stable complex with F-actin, was persistently retained at the spine, and consolidated spine expansion. In contrast, the postsynaptic density (PSD) was independently remodeled, as PSD scaffolding proteins did not change their amount and localization until a late protein synthesis-dependent third phase. Our findings show how and when spine substructures are remodeled during LTP and explain why synaptic plasticity rules change over time.},

	abstract = {Memory storage involves activity-dependent strengthening of synaptic transmission, a process termed long-term potentiation (LTP). The late phase of LTP is thought to encode long-term memory and involves structural processes that enlarge the synapse. Hence, understanding how synapse size is graded provides fundamental information about the information storage capability of synapses. Recent work using electron microscopy (EM) to quantify synapse dimensions has suggested that synapses may structurally encode as many as 26 functionally distinct states, which correspond to a series of proportionally spaced synapse sizes. Other recent evidence using super-resolution microscopy has revealed that synapses are composed of stereotyped nanoclusters of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors and scaffolding proteins; furthermore, synapse size varies linearly with the number of nanoclusters. Here we have sought to develop a model of synapse structure and growth that is consistent with both the EM and super-resolution data. We argue that synapses are composed of modules consisting of matrix material and potentially one nanocluster. LTP induction can add a trans-synaptic nanocluster to a module, thereby converting a silent module to an AMPA functional module. LTP can also add modules by a linear process, thereby producing an approximately 10-fold gradation in synapse size and strength.

A physiological model of memory formation, long‐term potentiation (LTP), has a late protein‐synthesis‐dependent phase (L‐LTP) that can last for many hours in slices or even for days in vivo. Could the activity‐dependent synthesis of new proteins account for the persistence of L‐LTP and memory? Here, we examine the proposal that a self‐sustaining regulation of translation can form a bistable switch that can persistently regulate the on‐site synthesis of plasticity‐related proteins. We show that an αCaMKII–CPEB1 molecular pair can operate as a bistable switch. Our results imply that L‐LTP should produce an increase in the total amount of αCaMKII at potentiated synapses. This study also proposes an explanation for why the application of protein synthesis and αCaMKII inhibitors at the induction and maintenance phases of L‐LTP result in very different outcomes.

SynopsisEach of us has memories that we can remember throughout our lifetime. Such memories are encoded, at the cellular level, by changes of synaptic efficacies. At the molecular level, changes in synaptic efficacies are expressed by changes in the number or conformational states of synaptic proteins. Synaptic proteins, however, have a much shorter lifetime than memories. How are such memories maintained despite a fast turnover of their molecular substrate? One clue is that the maintenance of long‐term memories requires the synthesis of new proteins. It is therefore feasible that the synthesis of new proteins compensates for the limited lifetimes of synaptic proteins. For such protein synthesis to be a mechanism for the maintenance of memory, it has to occur only in some synapses within one cell and not in others. Such synapse‐specific control of protein synthesis is unlikely to be implemented at the level of transcription. Experimental results have shown that the machinery for the translation of new proteins can be found in the vicinity of synapses, mRNAs for key synaptic proteins are found in synapses, and that translation of such proteins can be locally activated and can be regulated by translation factor proteins. Therefore, the regulation of translation might be a mechanism for synapse‐specific, protein‐synthesis‐dependent long‐term memory.Here, we propose that a self‐sustaining, synapse‐specific translational switch can account for the maintenance of memory despite protein turnover. This switch is based on a positive feedback loop between a memory protein and a translation factor protein, which regulates the synthesis of the memory protein through a closed loop. We select αCaMKII as a specific instantiation of the regulated molecule because of its functional interactions as well as its relative abundance (almost 2\% of total protein in brain is αCaMKII). The translation of αCaMKII is controlled by another molecule, CPEB1, which is in turn controlled by αCaMKII. The structure of this molecular network is shown in Figure 1. We test the feasibility of this idea by implementing a mathematical mass‐action model of this molecular network. We show that our proposed molecular network can indeed be a bistable switch. The ‘up’ state of this switch represents activity‐induced memory formation and the ‘down’ state represents the basal synaptic conductance.Previous experimental results have shown that protein synthesis inhibitors can prevent the formation of new memories but cannot cause us to forget memories that have been consolidated. These results could be interpreted as an indication that protein synthesis has no role in memory maintenance, posing a fundamental challenge to our hypothesis. Using our mathematical model, we show that the requirements for protein synthesis are very different during the formation of a new memory and during the maintenance of existing memory. In Figure 7, we show the differential effect of a partial blocking of protein synthesis during the induction and maintenance phases of memory formation. During the induction phase, a short moderate block of protein synthesis is sufficient for preventing the formation of a new memory, whereas during the maintenance phase, much longer and more complete blocks are required to reverse a previously established memory. Similar results are obtained with activity blockers of αCaMKII. These results suggest new experiments in which the duration and effectiveness of protein synthesis and activity blockers are taken into account. Such experiments can test the validity of this theory.Memory cannot be understood solely at the molecular level, and a complete understanding of memory formation and maintenance needs to take into account the different brain structures involved and the neuronal networks within each of these brain structures. However, all such higher level theories must be based on a solid understanding of what occurs at the molecular level. The theory proposed here suggests a molecular‐level mechanism on which the maintenance of memory at the neuronal network level might be based.
Memory can be maintained by a translation/activation loop.A specific instantiation of this loop composed of aCaMKII and CPEB1 can be bistable.Protein synthesis inhibitors can have a very different impact during the induction and maintenance phases.},

Yet, memory depends on synaptic protein receptors that are recycled in and out of the membrane at a fast rate, possibly several times an hour. Several proposals to bridge this vast gap in time scales between memory and its molecular substrate have relied on bistable molecular switches. Here, we propose an alternative to this approach based on clusters of interacting receptors in the synaptic membrane. We show that such clusters can be metastable and that the lifetime of such clusters can be many orders of magnitude larger than the lifetime of the receptors of which they are composed.

	abstract = {Spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) is a phenomenon in which the precise timing of spikes affects the sign and magnitude of changes in synaptic strength. STDP is often interpreted as the comprehensive learning rule for a synapse - the \&ldquo;first law\&rdquo; of synaptic plasticity. This interpretation is made explicit in theoretical models in which the total plasticity produced by complex spike patterns results from a superposition of the effects of all spike pairs. Although such models are appealing for their simplicity, they can fail dramatically. For example, the measured single-spike learning rule between hippocampal CA3 and CA1 pyramidal neurons does not predict the existence of long-term potentiation. Layers of complexity have been added to the basic STDP model to repair predictive failures, but they have been outstripped by experimental data. We propose an alternate first law: neural activity triggers changes in key biochemical intermediates, which act as a more direct trigger of plasticity mechanisms. One particularly successful model uses intracellular calcium as the intermediate and can account for many observed properties of bidirectional plasticity. In this formulation, STDP is not itself the basis for explaining other forms of plasticity, but is instead a consequence of changes in the biochemical intermediate, calcium. Eventually a mechanism-based framework for learning rules should include other messengers, discrete change at individual synapses, spread of plasticity among neighboring synapses, and priming of hidden processes that change a synapse\&rsquo;s susceptibility to future change. Mechanism-based models provide a rich framework for the computational representation of synaptic plasticity.},

	abstract = {Hebbian plasticity is thought to require glutamate signalling. We show this is not the case for hippocampal presynaptic long-term potentiation (LTPpre), which is expressed as an increase in transmitter release probability (Pr). We find that LTPpre can be induced by pairing pre- and postsynaptic spiking in the absence of glutamate signalling. LTPpre induction involves a non-canonical mechanism of retrograde nitric oxide signalling, which is triggered by Ca2+ influx from L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, not postsynaptic NMDA receptors (NMDARs), and does not require glutamate release. When glutamate release occurs, it decreases Pr by activating presynaptic NMDARs, and promotes presynaptic long-term depression. Net changes in Pr, therefore, depend on two opposing factors: (1) Hebbian activity, which increases Pr, and (2) glutamate release, which decreases Pr. Accordingly, release failures during Hebbian activity promote LTPpre induction. Our findings reveal a novel framework of presynaptic plasticity that radically differs from traditional models of postsynaptic plasticity., Neurons communicate with one another at junctions called synapses. One neuron at the synapse releases a chemical substance called a neurotransmitter, which binds to and activates the other neuron. The release of neurotransmitter thus enables the electrical activity of one cell to influence the electrical activity of another. The efficiency of this communication can change over time, as is thought to occur during learning. If the neurons on both sides of a synapse are repeatedly active at the same time, the ability of the neurons to transmit electrical signals to each other increases., One way that communication between neurons can become more efficient is if the first neuron becomes more likely to release neurotransmitter. Most synapses in the brain release a neurotransmitter called glutamate, and most types of learning involve changes in the efficiency of communication at glutamatergic synapses. But glutamate release is unreliable. Active glutamatergic neurons fail to release glutamate about 80\% of the time. If glutamate has a key role in learning, how does the brain learn efficiently when glutamate release is so unlikely?, To find out, Padamsey et al. studied glutamatergic synapses in slices of tissue from mouse and rat brains. When both neurons at a synapse were repeatedly active at the same time, the first neuron would sometimes become more likely to release glutamate. But this only happened at synapses in which the first neuron usually failed to release glutamate in the first place. This suggests that communication failures help to drive change at synapses. When two neurons that are often active at the same time do not communicate efficiently, this failure triggers molecular changes that make future communication more reliable., Previous results have shown that synapses can change when glutamate release occurs. The current results show that they can also change when it does not. This means that the brain can continue to learn despite frequent communication failures between neurons. Many neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, show altered glutamate signalling at synapses. Padamsey et al. hope that a better understanding of this process will lead to new therapies for these disorders.},

	abstract = {Background
The involvement of different NMDA receptor (NMDAR) subunits has been implicated in several forms of synaptic plasticity. However, it is still controversial to what extent the involvement is specific, and little is known about the role of NMDAR subunits in certain "non-conventional" forms of plasticity. In this study we used subunit-specific blockers to test the roles of NR2A- and NR2B-containing NMDARs in a type of chemical long-term depression (LTD) induced by brief bath application of the NMDAR agonist NMDA to hippocampal slices from 12–18 days old rats. For comparison, we also examined other forms of plasticity, including a "slow LTD" induced by 0.1 Hz stimulation under low Mg2+ conditions as well as long-term potentiation (LTP).

Results
A blocker of NR2A-containing NMDARs, NVP-AAM077 (NVP), substantially reduced the two forms of studied depression whereas blockers of NR2B-containing NMDARs, Ro25-6981 (Ro) or Ifenprodil (Ife), had no significant effect on them. LTP appeared to be more sensitive as it was fully blocked by NVP and partially blocked by Ro or Ife. However, the blocking effects of NVP could be counteracted by general amplification of NMDA responses by lowering Mg2+ concentration in the perfusion solution. Applying NVP or Ro/Ife on isolated NMDA-EPSPs recorded in low Mg2+ solution reduced responses to about 70\% and 20\% of initial size, respectively, whereas coapplication of both blockers almost completely abolished the responses. Additionally, NMDA application caused depotentiation of a pathway with prior tetanus-induced LTP, and NVP but not Ro/Ife substantially prevented that depotentiation as well as the chemical LTD of the control pathway. A second tetanus on the LTP pathway induced repotentiation which was fully blocked by NVP but partially blocked by Ro/Ife.

Conclusion
All of these results on hippocampal slices from young rats can be explained by a simple model, in which NR2A subunits dominate over NR2B subunits with respect to both plasticity and NMDAR-mediated responses. The model suggests that Ca2+ influx into the postsynaptic spine via different subtypes of NMDARs makes up a "final common pathway", controlling synaptic plasticity by its magnitude and temporal pattern regardless of the source.},

The results show that all PSDs contain a central mesh immediately underlying the postsynaptic membrane. Label for PSD-95 is found on both the cytoplasmic and cleft sides of this mesh, averaging 12 nm from the cleft side. All PSDs label for PSD-95. The properties of CaMKII labeling are quite different. Label is virtually absent on the cleft sides of PSDs, but can be heavy on the cytoplasmic side at a mean distance of 25 nm from the cleft. In tomograms, CaMKII holoenzymes can be visualized directly, appearing as labeled, tower-like structures reflecting the 20 nm diameter of the holoenzyme. These towers protrude from the cytoplasmic side of the central mesh. There appears to be a local organization of CaMKII, as judged by fact that the nearest-neighbor distances are nearly invariant over a wide range of labeling density for CaMKII. The average density of CaMKII holoenzymes is highly variable, ranging from zero to values approaching a tightly packed state. This variability is significantly higher than that for PSD-95 and is consistent with an information storage role for CaMKII.},

	abstract = {It has long been hypothesized that changes in dendritic spine structure may modify the physiological properties of synapses located on them. Due to their small size, large number, and highly variable shapes, standard light microscopy of Golgi impregnations and electron microscopy (EM) of single thin sections have not proved adequate to identify most spines in a sample or to quantify their structural dimensions and composition. Here we describe a new approach, the series sample, that was developed to classify by shape and subcellular composition all of the spines and synapses in a sample of neuropil by viewing them through serial EM sections. Spines in each class are then randomly selected for serial reconstruction and measurement in three dimensions. This approach was used to assess whether structural changes in hippocampal CA1 spines could contribute to the enhanced synaptic transmission and the greater endurance of long-term potentiation (LTP) that occur with maturation. Our results show a near doubling in the total density of synapses in the neuropil and along reconstructed dendrites between postnatal day 15 (PND 15) and adult ages. However, this doubling does not occur uniformly across all spine and synapse morphologies. Thin spines, mushroom spines containing perforated postsynaptic densities (PSDs) and spine apparatuses, and branched spines increase by about four-fold in density between PND 15 and adult ages. In contrast, stubby spines decrease by more than half and no change occurs in mushroom spines with macular PSDs or in dendritic shaft synapses. The stubby spines that remain are smaller in adults than at PND 15 and the mushroom spines are larger, while no change occurs in the three-dimensional structure of thin spines. Only a few spine necks at either age are constricted or long enough to attenuate charge transfer; therefore, the doubling in synapses should mediate the enhancement of synaptic transmission that occurs with maturation. In addition, LTP is not likely to be mediated by widening of spine necks at either age. However, the constricted spine necks could serve to concentrate specific molecules at activated synapses, thereby enhancing the specificity and endurance of LTP with maturation. These results demonstrate that the new series sample method combined with three- dimensional reconstruction reveals quantitative changes in the frequency and structure of spines and synapses that are not discernable by other methods and are likely to have dramatic effects on synaptic physiology and plasticity.},

	abstract = {Long-term memory is believed to be maintained by persistent modifications of synaptic transmission within the neural circuits that mediate behavior. Thus, long-term potentiation (LTP) is widely studied as a potential physiological basis for the persistent enhancement of synaptic strength that might sustain memory. Whereas the molecular mechanisms that initially induce LTP have been extensively characterized, the mechanisms that persistently maintain the potentiation have not. Recently, however, a candidate molecular mechanism linking the maintenance of LTP and the storage of long-term memory has been identified. The persistent activity of the autonomously active, atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) isoform, PKMζ, is both necessary and sufficient for maintaining LTP. Furthermore, blocking PKMζ activity by pharmacological or dominant negative inhibitors disrupts previously stored long-term memories in a variety of neural circuits, including spatial and trace memories in the hippocampus, aversive memories in the basolateral amygdala, appetitive memories in the nucleus accumbens, habit memory in the dorsal lateral striatum, and elementary associations, extinction, and skilled sensorimotor memories in the neocortex. During LTP and memory formation, PKMζ is synthesized de novo as a constitutively active kinase. This molecular mechanism for memory storage is evolutionarily conserved. PKMζ formation through new protein synthesis likely originated in early vertebrates {\textasciitilde}500 million years ago during the Cambrian period. Other mechanisms for forming persistently active PKM from aPKC are found in invertebrates, and inhibiting this atypical PKM disrupts long-term memory in the invertebrate model systems Drosophila melanogaster and Aplysia californica. Conversely, overexpressing PKMζ enhances memory in flies and rodents. PKMζ persistently enhances synaptic strength by maintaining increased numbers of AMPA receptors at postsynaptic sites, a mechanism that might have evolved from the general function of aPKC in trafficking membrane proteins to the apical compartment of polarized cells. This mechanism of memory may have had adaptive advantages because it is both stable and reversible, as demonstrated by the downregulation of experience-dependent, long-term increases in PKMζ after extinction and reconsolidation blockade that attenuate learned behavior. Thus, PKMζ, the “working end” of LTP, is a component of an evolutionarily conserved molecular mechanism for the persistent, yet flexible storage of long-term memory.},

Recently however, persistent phosphorylation by the atypical protein kinase C isoform, protein kinase Mzeta (PKMz), has been found to maintain late LTP in hippocampal slices.

	abstract = {Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) is an abundant synaptic signalling molecule that is essential for memory formation and the induction of synaptic potentiation. Additionally, CaMKII plays a prominent role in synaptic tagging and metaplasticity. These abilities are mediated by kinase activity as well as binding to a wide variety of synaptic proteins, including NMDA receptor subunits, modulating CaMKII location and activity. A characteristic feature is that autophosphorylation of CaMKII switches the kinase into autonomous activity. Since CaMKII can be autonomously active and because CaMKII is required for the formation of memory it is important that the kinase activity is adequately switched off. However, the exact time window of increased activity and how this is terminated, it is still matter of debate. After training in a memory task CaMKII activity is increased for at least 30 min. This CaMKII activity and further activation of CaMKII may be regulated by changes in the expression of two endogenous CaMKII inhibitor proteins, CaMKII inhibitor Alpha and Beta, as they are up-regulated early after training. These endogenous inhibitors specifically block CaMKII activity and they inhibit the association with NMDA receptor subunits. Thus, regulation of the expression of endogenous CaMKII inhibitors may constitute a novel negative feedback on CaMKII signalling during memory formation.},

A point mutation was introduced into the alphaCaMKII gene that blocked the autophosphorylation of threonine at position 286 (Thr286) of this kinase without affecting its CaM-dependent activity. The mutant mice had no N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-dependent LTP in the hippocampal CA1 area and showed no spatial learning in the Morris water maze.

Ca2+/calmodulin acts not only to activate the “kinase” subunit but also to present effectively the “substrate” subunit for autophosphorylation. Conversion of the kinase to the potentiated or trapped state is a cooperative process that is inefficient at low occupancy of calmodulin. Simulations show that repetitive Caz+ pulses at limiting calmodulin lead to the recruitment of calmodulin to the holoenzyme, which further stimulates autophosphorylation and trapping. This cooperative, positive feedback loop will potentiate the response of the kinase to sequential Caz+ transients and establish a threshold frequency at which the enzyme becomes highly active.},

In the presence of ATP, the binding of MBP occurred only with phosphorylated protein. The interaction of MBP with phosphorylated proteins also was demonstrated using thiophosphorylated proteins as competitive inhibitors. Kinetics parameters were determined. With phosphorylated light chains (P-LC20), the major difference between PP1c and MBP was a lower Km for the latter. With myosin, MBP showed a marked increase in kcat, compared to PP1c. ATP did not affect these parameters. To investigate the role of the large phosphatase subunit, two recombinant proteins representing the N-terminal two-thirds of the molecule were expressed. These activated PP1c, and activation was maximum at approximately an equimolar ratio. The equimolar mixture of recombinant fragment and PP1c exhibited Km values similar to MBP and increased kcat values, compared to PP1c alone. An affinity column was prepared using the recombinant fragment. Phosphorylated HMM and P-LC20 were bound in the presence and absence of ATP. The interaction of P-LC20 was not ATP-dependent. Dephosphorylated HMM did not bind in the presence of ATP. The N-terminal fragment of the large subunit also contained a binding site for PP1c. These results indicate that the N-terminal portion of the large subunit of MBP contained binding sites for P-LC20 and PP1c.},

Following PKA phosphorylation at a threonine, recombinant human I-1 was indistinguishable from rabbit skeletal muscle I-1 as a potent and specific inhibitor of the type-1 protein serine/threonine phosphatase (PP1). N-Terminal phosphopeptides of I-1 that retained the selectivity of intact human I-1 highlighted a functional domain that mediates PP1 inhibition. Substituting alanine in place of threonine-35 eliminated I-1 phosphorylation by PKA and its phosphatase inhibitor activity. An acidic residue was substituted in place of the phosphoacceptor to produce I-1(T35D), a constitutive phosphatase inhibitor. I-1(T35D) was an equally effective inhibitor of PP1 and the type-2 phosphatase, PP2A. However, CNBr digestion of I-1(T35D) yielded an N-terminal peptide that showed 100-fold increased specificity as a PP1 inhibitor. This provided new insight into a unique conformation of the phosphorylated I-1 that accounts for selective inhibition of PP1 activity. Truncation of an active I-1 phosphopeptide identified an N-terminal sequence that was required in addition to threonine-35 phosphorylation to inhibit PP1 activity. Biosensor studies demonstrated that PP1 bound to both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated I-1 and suggested that distinct elements of I-1 structure accounted for PP1 binding and inhibition. Our data point to multiple interactions between the I-1 functional domain and the PP1 catalytic subunit that define this phosphoprotein as a physiological regulator of the type-1 protein phosphatase.},

Moreover, activity-dependent remodeling was accompanied by altered protein turnover, occurred with corresponding increases or decreases in ubiquitin conjugation of synaptic proteins and required proteasome-mediated degradation. These modifications, in turn, reciprocally altered synaptic signaling to the downstream effectors CREB (cyclic AMP response element binding protein) and ERK-MAPK (extracellular signal regulated kinase–MAP kinase).

CaMKII in spines was specifically activated by NMDA receptors and L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, presumably by nanodomain Ca2+ near the channels, in response to glutamate uncaging and depolarization, respectively.

Knowledge regarding long-term memory has been impeded by the enormous complexity of the vertebrate brain, particularly the mammalian brain, as well as by the relative complexity of the behavioral alterations examined in most studies of long-term memory in vertebrates. Here, we demonstrate a long-term form of nonassociative learning-specifically, long-term habituation (LTH)-of a simple reflexive escape response, the C-start, in zebrafish larvae. The C-start is triggered by the activation of one of a pair of giant neurons in the zebrafish's hindbrain, the Mauthner cells. We show that LTH of the C-start requires the activity of NMDA receptors and involves macromolecular synthesis. We further show that the long-term habituated reflex can by rapidly dishabituated by a brief tactile stimulus. Our results set the stage for rigorous, mechanistic investigations of the long-term memory for habituation of a reflexive behavioral response, one that is mediated by a relatively simple, neurobiologically tractable, neural circuit. Moreover, the demonstration of NMDAR and transcriptionally dependent LTH in a translucent vertebrate organism should facilitate the use of optical recording, and optogenetic manipulation, of neuronal activity to elucidate the cellular basis of a long-term vertebrate memory.},

We then address whether LTP stabilization in fact requires protein synthesis, as this has been challenged in recent times much like the necessity for protein synthesis in the consolidation of long-term memory has been queried. We conclude that the case is still very strong for a necessary role of protein synthesis in LTP stabilization, even though the identities of the synthesized proteins and their contributions to the LTP process are not fully understood.

As an initial step toward understanding CaMKII inactivation, protein phosphatase classes (PP1, PP2A, PP2B, or PP2C) responsible for dephosphorylation of Thr286 in rat forebrain subcellular fractions were identified using phosphatase inhibitors/activators, by fractionation using ion exchange chromatography and by immunoblotting. PP2A-like enzymes account for {\textgreater}70\% of activity toward exogenous soluble Thr286-autophosphorylated CaMKII in crude cytosol, membrane, and cytoskeletal extracts; PP1 and PP2C account for the remaining activity. CaMKII is present in particulate fractions, specifically associated with postsynaptic densities (PSDs); each protein phosphatase is also present in isolated PSDs, but only PP1 is enriched during PSD isolation. When isolated PSDs dephosphorylated exogenous soluble Thr286-autophosphorylated CaMKII, PP2A again made the major contribution. However, CaMKII endogenous to PSDs (32P autophosphorylated in the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin) was predominantly dephosphorylated by PP1. In addition, dephosphorylation of soluble and PSD-associated CaMKII in whole forebrain extracts was catalyzed predominantly by PP2A and PP1, respectively. Thus, soluble and PSD-associated forms of CaMKII appear to be dephosphorylated by distinct enzymes, suggesting that Ca2+-independent activity of CaMKII is differentially regulated by protein phosphatases in distinct subcellular compartments.},

Once dissociated, CaMKII shows facilitated translocation for several minutes.

	abstract = {Changes in the synaptic connection strengths between neurons are believed to play a role in memory formation. An important mechanism for changing synaptic strength is through movement of neurotransmitter receptors and regulatory proteins to and from the synapse. Several activity-triggered biochemical events control these movements. Here we use computer models to explore how these putative memory-related changes can be stabilised long after the initial trigger, and beyond the lifetime of synaptic molecules. We base our models on published biochemical data and experiments on the activity-dependent movement of a glutamate receptor, AMPAR, and a calcium-dependent kinase, CaMKII. We find that both of these molecules participate in distinct bistable switches. These simulated switches are effective for long periods despite molecular turnover and biochemical fluctuations arising from the small numbers of molecules in the synapse. The AMPAR switch arises from a novel self-recruitment process where the presence of sufficient receptors biases the receptor movement cycle to insert still more receptors into the synapse. The CaMKII switch arises from autophosphorylation of the kinase. The switches may function in a tightly coupled manner, or relatively independently. The latter case leads to multiple stable states of the synapse. We propose that similar self-recruitment cycles may be important for maintaining levels of many molecules that undergo regulated movement, and that these may lead to combinatorial possible stable states of systems like the synapse.},

However, the original edition has been unavailable since 1966, ensuring that Hebb's comment that a classic normally means "cited but not read" is true in his case. This new edition rectifies a long-standing problem for behavioral neuroscientists--the inability to obtain one of the most cited publications in the field.   The Organization of Behavior played a significant part in stimulating the investigation of the neural foundations of behavior and continues to be inspiring because it provides a general framework for relating behavior to synaptic organization through the dynamics of neural networks.

	abstract = {Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) holoenzymes play a critical role in decoding Ca2+ signals in neurons. Understanding how this occurs has been the focus of numerous studies including many that use models. However, CaMKII is notoriously difficult to simulate in detail because of its multi-subunit nature, which causes a combinatorial explosion in the number of species that must be modeled. To study the Ca2+-calmodulin-CaMKII reaction network with detailed kinetics while including the effect of diffusion, we have customized an existing stochastic particle-based simulator, Smoldyn, to manage the problem of combinatorial explosion. With this new method, spatial and temporal aspects of the signaling network can be studied without compromising biochemical details. We used this new method to examine how calmodulin molecules, both partially loaded and fully loaded with Ca2+, choose pathways to interact with and activate CaMKII under various Ca2+ input conditions. We found that the dependence of CaMKII phosphorylation on Ca2+ signal frequency is intrinsic to the network kinetics and the activation pattern can be modulated by the relative amount of Ca2+ to calmodulin and by the rate of Ca2+ diffusion. Depending on whether Ca2+ influx is saturating or not, calmodulin molecules could choose different routes within the network to activate CaMKII subunits, resulting in different frequency dependence patterns. In addition, the size of the holoenzyme produces a subtle effect on CaMKII activation. The more extended the subunits are organized, the easier for calmodulin molecules to access and activate the subunits. The findings suggest that particular intracellular environmental factors such as crowding and calmodulin availability can play an important role in decoding Ca2+ signals and can give rise to distinct CaMKII activation patterns in dendritic spines, Ca2+ channel nanodomains and cytoplasm.},

In this review, John Lisman describes recent tests of the role of CaM kinase II in long-term potentiation. Experiments show that activity of CaM kinase II is increased for long periods of time after induction of long-term potentiation, that enhanced activity mimics long-term potentiation, and that enzyme activity is necessary for induction of long-term potentiation. The crucial question remaining is whether persistent enzyme activity is necessary to maintain stored information. Related issues concerning the mechanism by which synapses are weakened and the role of gene expression and structural changes are also discussed.},

The abundant synaptic protein CaMKII is necessary for long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory. However, whether CaMKII is required only during initial processes or whether it also mediates memory storage remains unclear. The most direct test of a storage role is the erasure test. In this test, a putative memory molecule is inhibited after learning. The key prediction is that this should produce persistent memory erasure even after the inhibitory agent is removed. We conducted this test using transient viral (HSV) expression of dominant-negative CaMKII-alpha (K42M) in the hippocampus. This produced persistent erasure of conditioned place avoidance. As an additional test, we found that expression of activated CaMKII (T286D/T305A/T306A) impaired place avoidance, a result not expected if a process other than CaMKII stores memory. Our behavioral results, taken together with prior experiments on LTP, strongly support a critical role of CaMKII in LTP maintenance and memory storage.},

Recently, common themes have begun to emerge in identifying the cellular basis of many conditions associated with learning and memory, mainly through the observation of dynamic changes to the dendritic spine. The ability of the dendritic spine to grow, shrink, and change shape has long been associated with synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. We develop a mathematical model that couples the biochemical signaling machinery and the actin remodeling events to provide insight into the dynamics of the dendritic spine., Transient spine enlargement (3- to 5-min timescale) is an important event associated with the structural plasticity of dendritic spines. Many of the molecular mechanisms associated with transient spine enlargement have been identified experimentally. Here, we use a systems biology approach to construct a mathematical model of biochemical signaling and actin-mediated transient spine expansion in response to calcium influx caused by NMDA receptor activation. We have identified that a key feature of this signaling network is the paradoxical signaling loop. Paradoxical components act bifunctionally in signaling networks, and their role is to control both the activation and the inhibition of a desired response function (protein activity or spine volume). Using ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based modeling, we show that the dynamics of different regulators of transient spine expansion, including calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), RhoA, and Cdc42, and the spine volume can be described using paradoxical signaling loops. Our model is able to capture the experimentally observed dynamics of transient spine volume. Furthermore, we show that actin remodeling events provide a robustness to spine volume dynamics. We also generate experimentally testable predictions about the role of different components and parameters of the network on spine dynamics.},

With time, structural changes become apparent, which in general require the synthesis of new proteins. The investigation of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these forms of synaptic plasticity has received much attention, because NMDA receptor–dependent LTP and LTD may constitute cellular substrates of learning and memory., Calcium influx through synaptic NMDA receptors triggers long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD).

Although this binary perspective has been valuable for understanding synaptic plasticity over long timescales, accumulating experimental evidence suggests that molecular switches also control cellular processing on short timescales. To investigate this idea further, a non-autonomous, nonlinear ordinary differential equation, representative of a bistable molecular switch, is analyzed. The existence and uniqueness of model solutions to arbitrary input is proved for both the high and low states of activity. These results suggest that sub-state switch activity is an analog signal that tracks instantaneous input frequency, thereby increasing the capacity for information transfer to downstream cellular targets. Using simple dynamics based on the ubiquitous Hill equation, the model and theory make intriguing predictions about synaptic plasticity and suggest a multiplexed encoding of instantaneous frequency information over short timescales, with integration of total activity over long timescales, helping to reconcile contrasting perspectives presented in the literature.},

Here, we show that a single holoenzyme of CaMKII per se serves as an erasable molecular memory switch. We reconstituted Ca(2+)/Calmodulin-dependent CaMKII autophosphorylation in the presence of protein phosphatase 1 in vitro, and found that CaMKII phosphorylation shows a switch-like response with history dependence (hysteresis) only in the presence of an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-derived peptide. This hysteresis is Ca(2+) and protein phosphatase 1 concentration-dependent, indicating that the CaMKII memory switch is not simply caused by an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-derived peptide lock of CaMKII in an active conformation. Mutation of a phosphorylation site of the peptide shifted the Ca(2+) range of hysteresis. These functions may be crucial for induction and maintenance of long-term synaptic plasticity at hippocampal synapses.},

We demonstrate that “large” Ca2+ transients occur when presynaptic NMDA receptors are activated following transmitter release. Presynaptic NMDA receptor activation proves critical in producing facilitation of transmission at theta frequencies. Because large Ca2+ transients “report” transmitter release, their frequency on a trial-by-trial basis can be used to estimate the probability of release, pr.

	abstract = {Changes in synaptic strength that underlie memory formation in the CNS are initiated by pulses of Ca2+ flowing through NMDA-type glutamate receptors into postsynaptic spines. Differences in the duration and size of the pulses determine whether a synapse is potentiated or depressed after repetitive synaptic activity. Calmodulin (CaM) is a major Ca2+ effector protein that binds up to four Ca2+ ions. CaM with bound Ca2+ can activate at least six signaling enzymes in the spine. In fluctuating cytosolic Ca2+, a large fraction of free CaM is bound to fewer than four Ca2+ ions. Binding to targets increases the affinity of CaM's remaining Ca2+-binding sites. Thus, initial binding of CaM to a target may depend on the target's affinity for CaM with only one or two bound Ca2+ ions. To study CaM-dependent signaling in the spine, we designed mutant CaMs that bind Ca2+ only at the two N-terminal or two C-terminal sites by using computationally designed mutations to stabilize the inactivated Ca2+-binding domains in the “closed” Ca2+-free conformation. We have measured their interactions with CaMKII, a major Ca2+/CaM target that mediates initiation of long-term potentiation. We show that CaM with two Ca2+ ions bound in its C-terminal lobe not only binds to CaMKII with low micromolar affinity but also partially activates kinase activity. Our results support the idea that competition for binding of CaM with two bound Ca2+ ions may influence significantly the outcome of local Ca2+ signaling in spines and, perhaps, in other signaling pathways.},

Recent work showed that enhanced synaptic activation, including induction of long-term potentiation and sensory stimulation, promote a rapid growth of dendritic filopodia and the formation of new spines or new types of synapses. Here, we investigated whether calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), an enzyme implicated in the control of synaptic efficacy, also participated in these mechanisms. We show that the intracellular application of autophosphorylated CaMKII reproduced these morphological changes and triggered filopodia growth and spine formation. In addition, we find that activation of endogenous kinase through the inhibition of phosphatases or the application of calmodulin in the cell produced similar effects. Conversely, blockade of CaMKII activity prevented the synaptic enhancement, the growth of filopodia and formation of new spines triggered by LTP induction, and a short anoxia/hypoglycemia. Together, these results support the interpretation that CaMKII contributes to the control of activity-dependent structural plasticity.},

Substantial evidence suggests that memory involves learning-dependent changes at synapses, a process termed long-term potentiation (LTP). Thus, understanding the storages process that underlies LTP may provide insight into how the engram is stored. LTP involves induction, maintenance (storage), and expression sub-processes; special tests are required to specifically reveal properties of the storage process. The strongest of these is the Erasure test in which a transiently applied agent that attacks a putative storage molecule may lead to persistent erasure of previously induced LTP/memory. Two major hypotheses have been proposed for LTP/memory storage: the CaMKII and PKM-zeta hypotheses. After discussing the tests that can be used to identify the engram (Necessity test, Saturation/Occlusion test, Erasure test), the status of these hypotheses is evaluated, based on the literature on LTP and memory-guided behavior. Review of the literature indicates that all three tests noted above support the CaMKII hypothesis when done at both the LTP level and at the behavioral level. Taken together, the results strongly suggest that the engram is stored by an LTP process in which CaMKII is a critical memory storage molecule.},

We show that topological approaches provide powerful means of dealing with the missing biochemical data. We first discuss the biochemical basis of gene regulation, and describe how genes can be connected into networks.

	abstract = {Communication between neurons within the brain occurs at chemical synapses
and is fundamental for all brain functions. Modulation of the strength of communication
is controlled by both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms and is termed synaptic
plasticity. One postsynaptic structure postulated to regulate synaptic strength is the
postsynaptic density (PSD), a large electron dense protein complex located just below
the synaptic membrane. The PSD, which is composed of signaling, scaffold and
cytoskeletal proteins, supports and organizes neurotransmitter receptors within the
synaptic membrane in addition to bridging signaling with the actin cytoskeletal network.
The protein composition and structure of PSDs is known to change in response to
synaptic activity and several PSD proteins are implicated in neurological conditions
characterized by synaptic dysfunction. However, there is a lack of information
regarding the variability of PSD structure and composition from individual PSDs across
the brain. In order to address this deficiency, PSDs were isolated from adult rat
cerebella, hippocampi and cerebral cortices three brain regions with unique neuronal
populations. The structure and composition of morphologically identified PSDs from
these regions was then compared through immunogold analysis and electron
tomography. Tomographic reconstructions revealed that while the majority of PSDs
shared a similar dense protein organization, there were cerebellar PSDs which
displayed a latticelike protein organization. PSDs from cortices and cerebellar were
also approximately twice as thick as hippocampal PSDs and thicker than previously
reported measurements. This suggests that the PSD extends further into the
postsynaptic spine than previously appreciated, presumably facilitating interactions with
the spine cytoskeletal network. Immunogold analysis of PSD scaffold proteins
suggested that the underlying PSD scaffold is quite variable across the brain, and even
within brain regions. Additionally, an immunogold analysis of two key molecules
documented to play roles in synaptic plasticity, CaMKII and the proteasome, supported
their potential role in structural modifications of the PSD. Together, these results
indicate that PSDs exhibit remarkable diversity in their composition and morphology,
presumably as a reflection of the unique functional demands placed on different
synapses.},

The program Smoldyn was used to develop scenarios of single molecule CaMKII diffusion and binding in virtual dendritic spines.

Additional cellular structures were then incorporated to simulate binding of CaMKII to the post-synaptic density (PSD); binding to cytoskeleton; or their self-aggregation. The distributions of GFP tagged native and mutant constructs in dissociated hippocampal neurons were measured to guide quantitative analysis. Intra-spine viscosity was estimated from fluorescence recovery after photo-bleach (FRAP) of red fluorescent protein. Intra-spine mobility of the GFP-CaMKIIα constructs was measured, with hundred-millisecond or better time resolution, from FRAP of distal spine tips in conjunction with fluorescence loss (FLIP) from proximal regions. Different FRAP {\textbackslash} FLIP profiles were predicted from our Scenarios and provided a means to differentiate binding to the PSDs from self-aggregation. The predictions were validated by experiments. Simulated fits of the Scenarios provided estimates of binding and rate constants. We utilized these values to assess the role of self-aggregation during the initial response of native CaMKII holoenzymes to stimulation. The computations revealed that self-aggregation could provide a concentration-dependent switch to amplify CaMKII sequestration and regulate its activity depending on its occupancy of the actin cytoskeleton.},

Models of plastic networks typically combine point neurons with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) as the learning rule. However, a point neuron does not capture the local non-linear processing of synaptic inputs allowed for by dendrites. Furthermore, experimental evidence suggests that STDP is not the only learning rule available to neurons. By implementing biophysically realistic neuron models, we study how dendrites enable multiple synaptic plasticity mechanisms to coexist in a single cell. In these models, we compare the conditions for STDP and for synaptic strengthening by local dendritic spikes. We also explore how the connectivity between two cells is affected by these plasticity rules and by different synaptic distributions. Finally, we show that how memory retention during associative learning can be prolonged in networks of neurons by including dendrites. Synaptic plasticity is the neuronal mechanism underlying learning. Here the authors construct biophysical models of pyramidal neurons that reproduce observed plasticity gradients along the dendrite and show that dendritic spike dependent LTP which is predominant in distal sections can prolong memory retention.},

Furthermore, binding to PSDs changes CaMKII from a substrate for protein phosphatase 2A to a protein phosphatase 1 substrate. Translocation of CaMKII to PSDs occurs in hippocampal slices following treatments that induce CaMKII autophosphorylation and a form of long term potentiation. Thus, synaptic activation leads to accumulation of autophosphorylated, activated CaMKII in the PSD.

Autophosphorylation of T286 is of special importance because it makes the enzyme active in the absence of Ca(2+), providing a biochemical memory that is critical for plasticity. To understand the factors controlling the duration of this state of CaMKII, we studied dephosphorylation of CaMKII in the post-synaptic density (PSD), a structure that defines a neuronal subcompartment critical for plasticity. We found that PSD-resident PP1 can dephosphorylate many sites on CaMKII, but not the T286 site that produces Ca(2+)-independent activity. This, together with previous work showing that soluble PP2A cannot dephosphorylate PSD CaMKII, provides a novel explanation for the in vivo persistence of T286 phosphorylation: after activated CaMKII translocates from the cytoplasm to the PSD, structural constraints prevent phosphatases from dephosphorylating T286. These results also suggest that the PSD is more than a simple scaffold for synaptic proteins; it may act to regulate the activity of proteins by positioning them in orientations that either prevent or favor specific biochemical reactions.},

As targeting subunits, PIPs contribute to substrate selection by bringing PP1 into the vicinity of specific substrates and by modulating substrate specificity via additional substrate docking sites or blocking substrate-binding channels.

Mitochondrial fusion–fission dynamics play a crucial role in many important cell processes. These dynamics control mitochondrial morphology, which in turn influences several important mitochondrial properties including mitochondrial bioenergetics and quality control, and they appear to be affected in several neurodegenerative diseases. However, an integrated and quantitative understanding of how fusion–fission dynamics control mitochondrial morphology has not yet been described. Here, we took advantage of modern visualisation techniques to provide a clear explanation of how fusion and fission correlate with mitochondrial length and motility in neurons. Our main findings demonstrate that: (1) the probability of a single mitochondrion splitting is determined by its length; (2) the probability of a single mitochondrion fusing is determined primarily by its motility; (3) the fusion and fission cycle is driven by changes in mitochondrial length and deviations from this cycle serves as a corrective mechanism to avoid extreme mitochondrial length; (4) impaired mitochondrial motility in neurons overexpressing 120Q Htt or Tau suppresses mitochondrial fusion and leads to mitochondrial shortening whereas stimulation of mitochondrial motility by overexpressing Miro-1 restores mitochondrial fusion rates and sizes. Taken together, our results provide a novel insight into the complex crosstalk between different processes involved in mitochondrial dynamics. This knowledge will increase understanding of the dynamic mitochondrial functions in cells and in particular, the pathogenesis of mitochondrial-related neurodegenerative diseases.},

	abstract = {Boolean threshold networks have recently been proposed as useful tools to model the dynamics of genetic regulatory networks, and have been successfully applied to describe the cell cycles of {\textbackslash}textit\{S. cerevisiae\} and {\textbackslash}textit\{S. pombe\}. Threshold networks assume that gene regulation processes are additive. This, however, contrasts with the mechanism proposed by S. Kauffman in which each of the logic functions must be carefully constructed to accurately take into account the combinatorial nature of gene regulation. While Kauffman Boolean networks have been extensively studied and proved to have the necessary properties required for modeling the fundamental characteristics of genetic regulatory networks, not much is known about the essential properties of threshold networks. Here we study the dynamical properties of these networks with different connectivities, activator-repressor proportions, activator-repressor strengths and different thresholds. Special attention is paid to the way in which the threshold value affects the dynamical regime in which the network operates and the structure of the attractor landscape. We find that only for a very restricted set of parameters, these networks show dynamical properties consistent with what is observed in biological systems. The virtues of these properties and the possible problems related with the restrictions are discussed and related to earlier work that uses these kind of models.},

	abstract = {The kinetics of exocytosis and endocytosis were studied in the giant synaptic terminal of depolarizing bipolar cells from the goldfish retina. Two techniques were applied: capacitance measurements of changes in membrane surface area, and fluorescence measurements of exocytosis using the membrane dye FM1-43.
            
            
              Three phases of exocytosis occurred during maintained depolarization to 0 mV. The first component was complete within about 10 ms and involved a pool of 1200–1800 vesicles (with a total membrane area equivalent to about 1.6\% of the surface of the terminal). The second component of exocytosis involved the release of about 4400 vesicles over 1 s. The third component of exocytosis was stimulated continuously at a rate of about 1000 vesicles s−1.
            
            
              After short depolarizations ({\textless} 200 ms), neither the FM1-43 signal nor the capacitance signal continued to rise, indicating that exocytosis stopped rapidly after closure of Ca2+ channels. The fall in capacitance could therefore be used to monitor endocytosis independently of exocytosis. The capacitance measured after brief stimuli began to fall immediately, recovering to the pre-stimulus baseline with a rate constant of 0.8 s−1.
            
            
              The amount of exocytosis measured using the capacitance and FM1-43 techniques was similar during the first 200 ms of depolarization, suggesting that the most rapidly released vesicles could be detected by either method.
            
            
              After a few seconds of continuous stimulation, the net increase in membrane surface area reached a plateau at about 5\%, even though continuous exocytosis occurred at a rate of 0.9\% s−1. Under these conditions of balanced exocytosis and endocytosis, the rate constant of endocytosis was about 0.2 s−1. The average rate of endocytosis during maintained depolarization was therefore considerably slower than the rate observed after a brief stimulus.
            
            
              After longer depolarizations ({\textgreater} 500 ms), both the capacitance and FM1-43 signals continued to rise for periods of seconds after closure of Ca2+ channels. The continuation of exocytosis was correlated with a persistent increase in [Ca2+]i in the synaptic terminal, as indicated by the activation of a Ca2+-dependent conductance and measurements of [Ca2+]i using the fluorescent indicator furaptra.
            
            
              The delayed fall in membrane capacitance after longer depolarizations occurred along a double exponential time course indicating the existence of two endocytic processes: fast endocytosis, with a rate constant of 0.8 s−1, and slow endocytosis, with a rate constant of 0.1 s−1.
            
            
              Increasing the duration of depolarization caused an increase in the fraction of membrane recovered by slow endocytosis. After a 100 ms stimulus, all the membrane was recycled by fast endocytosis, but after a 5 s depolarization, about 50\% of the membrane was recycled by slow endocytosis.
            
            
              These results demonstrate the existence of fast and slow endocytic mechanisms at a synapse and support the idea that prolonged stimulation leads to an increase in the amount of membrane retrieved by the slower route. The rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+ that occurred during longer depolarizations was correlated with stimulation of continuous exocytosis and inhibition of fast endocytosis. The results also confirm that transient and continuous components of exocytosis coexist in the synaptic terminal of depolarizing bipolar cells.},

	abstract = {Summary
The primate brain contains a hierarchy of visual areas, dubbed the ventral stream, which rapidly computes object representations that are both specific for object identity and robust against identity-preserving transformations, like depth rotations [1, 2]. Current computational models of object recognition, including recent deep-learning networks, generate these properties through a hierarchy of alternating selectivity-increasing filtering and tolerance-increasing pooling operations, similar to simple-complex cells operations [3–6]. Here, we prove that a class of hierarchical architectures and a broad set of biologically plausible learning rules generate approximate invariance to identity-preserving transformations at the top level of the processing hierarchy. However, all past models tested failed to reproduce the most salient property of an intermediate representation of a three-level face-processing hierarchy in the brain: mirror-symmetric tuning to head orientation [7]. Here, we demonstrate that one specific biologically plausible Hebb-type learning rule generates mirror-symmetric tuning to bilaterally symmetric stimuli, like faces, at intermediate levels of the architecture and show why it does so. Thus, the tuning properties of individual cells inside the visual stream appear to result from group properties of the stimuli they encode and to reflect the learning rules that sculpted the information-processing system within which they reside.},

Although the simultaneous measurement of all internal variables, like all metabolite concentrations in a cell, offers a complete description of a system’s state, in practice experimental access is limited to only a subset of variables, or sensors. A system is called observable if we can reconstruct the system’s complete internal state from its outputs. Here, we adopt a graphical approach derived from the dynamical laws that govern a system to determine the sensors that are necessary to reconstruct the full internal state of a complex system. We apply this approach to biochemical reaction systems, finding that the identified sensors are not only necessary but also sufficient for observability. The developed approach can also identify the optimal sensors for target or partial observability, helping us reconstruct selected state variables from appropriately chosen outputs, a prerequisite for optimal biomarker design. Given the fundamental role observability plays in complex systems, these results offer avenues to systematically explore the dynamics of a wide range of natural, technological and socioeconomic systems.},

	abstract = {We asymptotically calculate the spatially averaged mean first passage time (MFPT) of a diffusing channel protein in a finite membrane patch containing a small absorbing anchor site. Different two-dimensional membrane geometries are considered including a circular, a square-shaped, a rectangular, and a cylindrical domain. The asymptotic expressions are found to be in excellent agreement with results from Monte Carlo simulations if the radius of the diffusing protein is sufficiently small. For a larger radius, a simple correction to the asymptotic expressions is proposed. We show that the average MFPT for a circle and a square-shaped domain of the same area are approximately equal as long as the anchor site is close to the center of the domain. We also discuss how the average MFPT depends on the aspect ratio of a rectangular and a cylindrical domain. Among such domains with a fixed area, a minimal MFPT is obtained for the square-shaped domain.},

Although the bulk of evidence supports receptor saturation, recent studies have started to reveal that α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors may not be saturated by a single vesicle of glutamate. Here, we address this question through a study of putative single synapses, made by hippocampal neurons in culture, that are identified by FM1–43 staining. An analysis of the sources of variability in the amplitudes of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents at single synapses reveals that this variability must arise presynaptically, from variations in the quantity of agonist released. Thus, glutamate receptors at hippocampal synapses are not generally saturated by quantal release.},

We studied [Ca(2+)] signaling in dendritic spines of CA1 pyramidal neurons and find that spines are specialized structures with low endogenous Ca(2+) buffer capacity that allows large and extremely rapid [Ca(2+)] changes. Under physiological conditions, Ca(2+) diffusion across the spine neck is negligible, and the spine head functions as a separate compartment on long time scales, allowing localized Ca(2+) buildup during trains of synaptic stimuli. Furthermore, the kinetics of Ca(2+) sources governs the time course of [Ca(2+)] signals and may explain the selective activation of long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) by NMDA-R-mediated synaptic Ca(2+).},

Because the mass represents the sum of the molecular masses of all of the molecules comprising a PSD, it becomes possible to derive the number of copies of each protein, once its relative mass contribution is known. Mass contributions of PSD-95, synapse-associated protein (SAP)97, and α-Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) were determined by quantitative gel electrophoresis of PSD fractions. The number of PSD-95 molecules per average PSD, contributing 2.3\% of the mass of the PSD, was calculated to be 300, whereas the number of SAP97 molecules, contributing 0.9\% of the mass of the PSD, was 90. The α-CaMKII holoenzymes, which contribute 6\% of the mass when brains are homogenized within 2 min of interrupting blood flow, have 80 holoenzymes associated with a typical PSD. When blood flow is interrupted 15 min before homogenization, the average mass of PSDs increases by ≈40\%. The additional α-CaMKII associated with PSDs accounts for up to 20\% of this mass increase, representing the addition of 100–200 α-CaMKII holoenzymes.},

	abstract = {One of the key questions in neuroscience is how our brain self-organises to efficiently process information. To answer this question, we need to understand the underlying mechanisms of plasticity and their role in shaping synaptic connectivity. Theoretical neuroscience typically investigates plasticity on the level of neural networks. Neural network models often consist of point neurons, completely neglecting neuronal morphology for reasons of simplicity. However, during the past decades it became increasingly clear that inputs are locally processed in the dendrites before they reach the cell body. Dendritic properties enable local interactions between synapses and location-dependent modulations of inputs, rendering the position of synapses on dendrites highly important. These insights changed our view of neurons, such that we now think of them as small networks of nearly independent subunits instead of a simple point. Here, we propose that understanding how the brain processes information strongly requires that we consider the following properties: which plasticity mechanisms are present in the dendrites and how do they enable the self-organisation of synapses across the dendritic tree for efficient information processing? Ultimately, dendritic plasticity mechanisms can be studied in networks of neurons with dendrites, possibly uncovering unknown mechanisms that shape the connectivity in our brains.},

We calculate much larger storage capacities for cells with nonlinear subunits and show that this capacity is accessible to a structural learning rule that combines random synapse formation with activity-dependent stabilization/elimination. In a departure from the common view that memories are encoded in the overall connection strengths between neurons, our results suggest that long-term information storage in neural tissue could reside primarily in the selective addressing of synaptic contacts onto dendritic subunits.},

Despite, and perhaps because of, this, sensory systems are able to render highly accurate representations of stimuli. In the retina, for example, photoreceptors transform light into electric signals, which are later processed by a significantly smaller network of ganglion cells before entering the optic nerve. How then is sensory information preserved along such a pathway? In this work, we put forth a possible answer to this question using compressed sensing, a recent advance in the field of signal processing that demonstrates how sparse signals can be reconstructed using very few samples. Through model simulation, we discover that stimuli can be recovered from ganglion-cell dynamics, and demonstrate how localized receptive fields improve stimulus encoding. We hypothesize that organisms have evolved to utilize the sparsity of stimuli, demonstrating that compressed sensing may be a universal information-processing framework underlying both information acquisition and retention in sensory systems.},

First, how can we form adequate theoretical frameworks for understanding how dynamical network processes cooperate across widely disparate spatiotemporal scales to solve important computational problems? Second, how can we extract meaningful models of neuronal systems from high dimensional datasets? To aid in these challenges, we give a pedagogical review of a collection of ideas and theoretical methods arising at the intersection of statistical physics, computer science and neurobiology. We introduce the interrelated replica and cavity methods, which originated in statistical physics as powerful ways to quantitatively analyze large highly heterogeneous systems of many interacting degrees of freedom. We also introduce the closely related notion of message passing in graphical models, which originated in computer science as a distributed algorithm capable of solving large inference and optimization problems involving many coupled variables. We then show how both the statistical physics and computer science perspectives can be applied in a wide diversity of contexts to problems arising in theoretical neuroscience and data analysis. Along the way we discuss spin glasses, learning theory, illusions of structure in noise, random matrices, dimensionality reduction and compressed sensing, all within the unified formalism of the replica method. Moreover, we review recent conceptual connections between message passing in graphical models, and neural computation and learning. Overall, these ideas illustrate how statistical physics and computer science might provide a lens through which we can uncover emergent computational functions buried deep within the dynamical complexities of neuronal networks.},

	abstract = {CaMKII plays a critical role in long-term potentiation (LTP). The kinase is a major component of the postsynaptic density (PSD); however, it is also contained in the spine cytoplasm. CaMKII can now be monitored optically in living neurons, and it is therefore important to understand the contribution of the PSD and cytoplasmic pools to optical signals. Here, we estimate the size of these pools under basal conditions. From EM immunolabeling data, we calculate that the PSD/cytoplasmic ratio is {\textasciitilde}5\%. A second independent estimate is derived from measurements indicating that the average mushroom spine PSD contains 90 to 240 holoenzymes. A cytoplasmic concentration of 16 μM ({\textasciitilde}2590 holoenzymes) in the spine can be estimated from the total measured CaMKII content of hippocampal tissue, the relative volume of different compartments, and the spine-dendrite ratio of CaMKII (2:1). These numbers yield a second estimate (6\%) of the PSD/spine ratio in good agreement with the first. The CaMKII bound to the NMDAR is important because preventing the formation of this complex blocks LTP induction. We estimate that the percentage of spine CaMKII held active by binding to the NMDAR is {\textasciitilde}0.2\%. Implications of the high spine concentration of CaMKII ({\textgreater} 100 μM alpha subunits) and the small fraction within the PSD are discussed. Of particular note, the finding that the CaMKII signal in spines shows only transient activation (open state) after LTP induction is subject to the qualification that it does not reflect the small but important pool bound to the NMDAR.},

	abstract = {Long-term potentiation of synapse strength requires enlargement of dendritic spines on cerebral pyramidal neurons. Long-term depression is linked to spine shrinkage. Indeed, spines are dynamic structures: they form, change their shapes and volumes, or can disappear in the space of hours. Do all such changes result from synaptic activity, or do some changes result from intrinsic processes? How do enlargement and shrinkage of spines relate to elimination and generation of spines, and how do these processes contribute to the stationary distribution of spine volumes? To answer these questions, we recorded the volumes of many individual spines daily for several days using two-photon imaging of CA1 pyramidal neurons in cultured slices of rat hippocampus between postnatal days 17 and 23. With normal synaptic transmission, spines often changed volume or were created or eliminated, thereby showing activity-dependent plasticity. However, we found that spines changed volume even after we blocked synaptic activity, reflecting a native instability of these small structures over the long term. Such “intrinsic fluctuations” showed unique dependence on spine volume. A mathematical model constructed from these data and the theory of random fluctuations explains population behaviors of spines, such as rates of elimination and generation, stationary distribution of volumes, and the long-term persistence of large spines. Our study finds that generation and elimination of spines are more prevalent than previously believed, and spine volume shows significant correlation with its age and life expectancy. The population dynamics of spines also predict key psychological features of memory.},

	abstract = {The dodecameric holoenzyme of calcium–calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) responds to high-frequency Ca2+ pulses to become Ca2+ independent. A simple coincidence-detector model for Ca2+-frequency dependency assumes noncooperative activation of kinase domains. We show that activation of CaMKII by Ca2+–calmodulin is cooperative, with a Hill coefficient of {\textasciitilde}3.0, implying sequential kinase-domain activation beyond dimeric units. We present data for a model in which cooperative activation includes the intersubunit 'capture' of regulatory segments. Such a capture interaction is seen in a crystal structure that shows extensive contacts between the regulatory segment of one kinase and the catalytic domain of another. These interactions are mimicked by a natural inhibitor of CaMKII. Our results show that a simple coincidence-detection model cannot be operative and point to the importance of kinetic dissection of the frequency-response mechanism in future experiments.},

	abstract = {Limiting distributions are derived for the sparse connected components that are present when a random graph on n vertices has approximately 1/2n edges. In particular, we show that such a graph consists entirely of trees, unicyclic components, and bicyclic components with probability approaching √2/3 cosh √5/18 ≈ 0.9325 as n→∞. The limiting probability that it is consists of trees, unicyclic components, and at most one another component is approximately 0.9957; the limiting probability that it is planar lies between 0.987 and 0.9998. When a random graph evolves and the number of edges passes 1/2n, its components grow in cyclic complexity according to an interesting Markov process whose asymptotic structure is derived. The probability that there never is more than a single component with more edges than vertices, throughout the veolution, approaches 5 π/18 ≈ 0.8727. A “uniform” model of random graphs, which allows self-loops and multiple edges, is shown to lead to formulas that are substanitially simpler than the analogous formulas for the classical random graphs of Erdõs and Rényi. The notions of “excess” and “deficiency,” which are significant characteristics of the generating function as well as of the graphs themselves, lead to a mathematically attractive structural theory for the uniform model. A general approach to the study of stopping configurations makes it possible to sharpen previously obtained estimates in a uniform manner and often to obtain closed forms for the constants of interest. Empirical results are presented to complement the analysis, indicating the typical behavior when n is near 2oooO. © 1993 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Here we report large scale relative and absolute quantification of proteins in PSDs purified from adult rat forebrain and cerebellum. PSD protein profiles were determined using the cleavable ICAT strategy and LC-MS/MS. A total of 296 proteins were identified and quantified with 43 proteins exhibiting statistically significant abundance change between forebrain and cerebellum, indicating marked molecular heterogeneity of PSDs between different brain regions. Moreover we utilized absolute quantification strategy, in which synthetic isotope-labeled peptides were used as internal standards, to measure the molar abundance of 32 key PSD proteins in forebrain and cerebellum. These data confirm the abundance of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and PSD-95 and reveal unexpected stoichiometric ratios between glutamate receptors, scaffold proteins, and signaling molecules in the PSD. Our data also demonstrate that the absolute quantification method is well suited for targeted quantitative proteomic analysis. Overall this study delineates a crucial molecular difference between forebrain and cerebellar PSDs and provides a quantitative framework for measuring the molecular stoichiometry of the PSD.},

	abstract = {Studies of structural plasticity in the brain often require the detection and analysis of axonal synapses (boutons). To date, bouton detection has been largely manual or semi-automated, relying on a step that traces the axons before detection the boutons. If tracing the axon fails, the accuracy of bouton detection is compromised. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that does not require tracing the axon to detect axonal boutons in 3D two-photon images taken from the mouse cortex. To find the most appropriate techniques for this task, we compared several well-known algorithms for interest point detection and feature descriptor generation. The final algorithm proposed has the following main steps: (1) a Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) based feature enhancement module to accentuate the appearance of boutons; (2) a Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) interest point detector to find candidate locations for feature extraction; (3) non-maximum suppression to eliminate candidates that were detected more than once in the same local region; (4) generation of feature descriptors based on Gabor filters; (5) a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, trained on features from labelled data, and was used to distinguish between bouton and non-bouton candidates. We found that our method achieved a Recall of 95\%, Precision of 76\%, and F1 score of 84\% within a new dataset that we make available for accessing bouton detection. On average, Recall and F1 score were significantly better than the current state-of-the-art method, while Precision was not significantly different. In conclusion, in this article we demonstrate that our approach, which is independent of axon tracing, can detect boutons to a high level of accuracy, and improves on the detection performance of existing approaches.

These changes can be induced by rather short stimuli (lasting sometimes only a few seconds) but should then be stable for months or years in order to be useful for long-term memory. Experimentalists have shown that synapses undergo a sequence of steps that transforms the rapid change during the early phase of synaptic plasticity into a stable memory trace in the late phase. In this paper we introduce a model with a small number of equations that can describe the phenomena of induction of synaptic changes during the early phase of synaptic plasticity, the trigger process for protein synthesis, and the final stabilization. The model covers a broad range of experimental phenomena known as tagging experiments and makes testable predictions. The ability to model the stabilization of synapses is crucial to understand learning and memory processes in animals and humans and a necessary ingredient for any large-scale model of the brain.},

	volume = {17},
	issn = {0953-816X},
	abstract = {Postsynaptic Ca2+ signals of different amplitudes and durations are able to induce either long-lasting potentiation (LPT) or depression (LTD). The bidirectional character of synaptic plasticity may result at least in part from an increased or decreased responsiveness of the glutamatergic alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptor (AMPA-R) due to the modification of conductance and/or channel number, and controlled by the balance between the activities of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation pathways. AMPA-R depression can be induced by a long-lived Ca2+ signal of moderate amplitude favouring the activation of the dephosphorylation pathway, whereas a shorter but higher Ca2+ signal would induce AMPA-R potentiation resulting from the preferential activation of the phosphorylation pathway. Within the framework of a model involving calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), calcineurin (PP2B) and type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1), we aimed at delineating the conditions allowing a biphasic U-shaped relationship between AMPA-R and Ca2+ signal amplitude, and thus bidirectional plasticity. Our theoretical analysis shows that such a property may be observed if the phosphorylation pathway: (i) displays higher cooperativity in its Ca2+-dependence than the dephosphorylation pathway; (ii) displays a basal Ca2+-independent activity; or (iii) is directly inhibited by the dephosphorylation pathway. Because the experimentally observed inactivation of CaMKII by PP1 accounts for this latter characteristic, we aimed at verifying whether a realistic model using reported parameters values can simulate the induction of either LTP or LTD, depending on the time and amplitude characteristics of the Ca2+ signal. Our simulations demonstrate that the experimentally observed bidirectional nature of Ca2+-dependent synaptic plasticity could be the consequence of the PP1-mediated inactivation of CaMKII.},

Thus, protein phosphatase-1-mediated regulation of NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity involves heterogeneous molecular mechanisms, in both different dendritic subregions and different neuronal subtypes.

	abstract = {The phosphoprotein DARPP-32 (dopamine and cyclic adenosine 3´, 5´-monophosphate-regulated phosphoprotein, 32 kDa) is an important component in the molecular regulation of postsynaptic signaling in neostriatum. Despite the importance of this phosphoprotein, there is as yet little known about the nanoscale distribution of DARPP-32. In this study we applied superresolution stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED) to assess the expression and distribution of DARPP-32 in striatal neurons. Primary culture of striatal neurons were immunofluorescently labeled for DARPP-32 with Alexa-594 and for the dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) with atto-647N. Dual-color STED microscopy revealed discrete localizations of DARPP-32 and D1R in the spine structure, with clustered distributions in both head and neck. Dissected spine structures reveal that the DARPP-32 signal rarely overlapped with the D1R signal. The D1R receptor is positioned in an “aggregated” manner primarily in the spine head and to some extent in the neck, while DARPP-32 forms several neighboring small nanoclusters spanning the whole spine structure. The DARPP-32 clusters have a mean size of 52 +/- 6 nm, which is close to the resolution limit of the microscope and corresponds to the physical size of a few individual phosphoprotein immunocomplexes. Dissection of synaptic proteins using superresolution microscopy gives possibilities to reveal in better detail biologically relevant information, as compared to diffraction-limited microscopy. In this work, the dissected postsynaptic topology of the DARPP-32 phosphoprotein provides strong evidence for a compartmentalized and confined distribution in dendritic spines. The protein topology and the relatively low copy number of phosphoprotein provides a conception of DARPP-32’s possibilities to fine-tune the regulation of synaptic signaling, which should have an impact on the performance of the neuronal circuits in which it is expressed.},

PP1 activity is necessary for the induction of long-term depression, whereas downregulation of PP1 activity is required for the normal induction of long-term potentiation. However, how PP1 is activated is not clear. Moreover, it is not known whether PP1 plays a role in homeostatic synaptic scaling, another form of synaptic plasticity which functions to reset the neuronal firing rate in response to chronic neuronal activity perturbations. In this study, we found that PP1 inhibitor-2 (I-2) is phosphorylated at serine 43 (S43) in rat and mouse cortical neurons in response to bicuculine application. Expression of I-2 phosphorylation-blocking mutant I-2 (S43A) blocked the dephosphorylation of GluA2 at serine 880, AMPA receptor trafficking, and synaptic downscaling induced by bicuculline application. Our data suggest that the phosphorylation of I-2 at S43 appears to be mediated by L-type calcium channels and calcium/calmodulin-dependent myosin light-chain kinase. Our work thus reveals a novel calcium-induced PP1 activation pathway critical for homeostatic synaptic plasticity.},

How are response pathways triggered on the application of a stress? Such questions of differentiation, signal transduction, and stress response, while seemingly diverse, all pertain to the storage of state information, or “memory,” by biochemical switches. Just as a computer memory unit can store a bit of 0 or 1 through electrical signals, a biochemical switch can be in one of two states, where chemical signals are on or off. This lets the cell record the presence/absence of an environmental stimulus, the level of a signaling molecule, or the result of a cell fate decision. There are a small number of published ways by which a group of chemical reactions come together to realize a switch. We undertook an exhaustive computational exploration to see if chemical switches are indeed rare and found, surprisingly, that they are actually abundant, highly diverse, but related to one another. Our catalog of switches opens up new bioinformatics approaches to understanding cellular decision making and cellular memory.},

	abstract = {Dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex undergo activity-dependent structural remodelling that has been proposed to be a cellular basis of learning and memory. How structural remodelling supports synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation, and whether such plasticity is input-specific at the level of the individual spine has remained unknown. We investigated the structural basis of long-term potentiation using two-photon photolysis of caged glutamate at single spines of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Here we show that repetitive quantum-like photorelease (uncaging) of glutamate induces a rapid and selective enlargement of stimulated spines that is transient in large mushroom spines but persistent in small spines. Spine enlargement is associated with an increase in AMPA-receptor-mediated currents at the stimulated synapse and is dependent on NMDA receptors, calmodulin and actin polymerization. Long-lasting spine enlargement also requires Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Our results thus indicate that spines individually follow Hebb's postulate for learning. They further suggest that small spines are preferential sites for long-term potentiation induction, whereas large spines might represent physical traces of long-term memory.},

	abstract = {The brain extracts behaviourally relevant sensory input to produce appropriate motor output. On the one hand, our constantly changing environment requires this transformation to be plastic. On the other hand, plasticity is thought to be balanced by mechanisms ensuring constancy of neuronal representations in order to achieve stable behavioural performance. Yet, prominent changes in synaptic strength and connectivity also occur during normal sensory experience, indicating a certain degree of constitutive plasticity. This raises the question of how stable neuronal representations are on the population level and also on the single neuron level. Here, we review recent data from longitudinal electrophysiological and optical recordings of single-cell activity that assess the long-term stability of neuronal stimulus selectivities under conditions of constant sensory experience, during learning, and after reversible modification of sensory input. The emerging picture is that neuronal representations are stabilized by behavioural relevance and that the degree of long-term tuning stability and perturbation resistance directly relates to the functional role of the respective neurons, cell types and circuits. Using a ‘toy’ model, we show that stable baseline representations and precise recovery from perturbations in visual cortex could arise from a ‘backbone’ of strong recurrent connectivity between similarly tuned cells together with a small number of ‘anchor’ neurons exempt from plastic changes.

Thr35 is phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (A kinase), and Thr35-phosphorylated I-1 inhibits PP1. Until now the kinase that phosphorylates Ser67 had not been identified and the physiological role of Ser67 phosphorylation was unknown. In this study we detected a high level of kinase activity in brain extract when a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion I-1 mutant containing an Ala substituted for Thr35 [GST-I-1(T35A)] was used as the substrate. GST-I-1(T35A) kinase and neuronal cdc2-like protein kinase (NCLK) in the brain extract could not be separated from each other by a series of sequential chromatographies. GST-I-1(T35A) kinase immunoprecipitated with anti-NCLK antibody from kinase-active column fractions. Purified NCLK-phosphorylated GST-I-1(T35A) and I-1 (0.7 mole of phosphate per mole of I-1). HPLC phosphopeptide mapping, amino acid sequencing, and site-directed mutagenesis determined that NCLK phosphorylates Ser67 of I-1. NCLK-phosphorylated I-1 and I-1(T35A) inhibited PP1 with IC50 values ≈9.5 and 13.8 nM, respectively. When compared, A kinase-phosphorylated I-1 was only ≈1.2 times more inhibitory than NCLK-phosphorylated I-1. Our data indicate that NCLK is a potential in vivo I-1 kinase and that Thr35 and Ser67 phosphorylation independently activate I-1.},

Our model describes several nonlinear effects that are observed in STDP experiments, as well as the voltage dependence of plasticity. We found that, in a simulated recurrent network of spiking neurons, our plasticity rule led not only to development of localized receptive fields but also to connectivity patterns that reflect the neural code. For temporal coding procedures with spatio-temporal input correlations, strong connections were predominantly unidirectional, whereas they were bidirectional under rate-coded input with spatial correlations only. Thus, variable connectivity patterns in the brain could reflect different coding principles across brain areas; moreover, our simulations suggested that plasticity is fast.},

Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is a major eukaryotic protein serine/threonine phosphatase that regulates an enormous variety of cellular functions through the interaction of its catalytic subunit (PP1c) with over fifty different established or putative regulatory subunits. Most of these target PP1c to specific subcellular locations and interact with a small hydrophobic groove on the surface of PP1c through a short conserved binding motif – the RVxF motif – which is often preceded by further basic residues. Weaker interactions may subsequently enhance binding and modulate PP1 activity/specificity in a variety of ways. Several putative targeting subunits do not possess an RVxF motif but nevertheless interact with the same region of PP1c. In addition, several ‘modulator’ proteins bind to PP1c but do not possess a domain targeting them to a specific location. Most are potent inhibitors of PP1c and possess at least two sites for interaction with PP1c, one of which is identical or similar to the RVxF motif.Regulation of PP1c in response to extracellular and intracellular signals occurs mostly through changes in the levels, conformation or phosphorylation status of targeting subunits. Understanding of the mode of action of PP1c complexes may facilitate development of drugs that target particular PP1c complexes and thereby modulate the phosphorylation state of a very limited subset of proteins.},

	abstract = {In reward learning, the integration of NMDA-dependent calcium and dopamine by striatal projection neurons leads to potentiation of corticostriatal synapses through CaMKII/PP1 signaling. In order to elicit the CaMKII/PP1-dependent response, the calcium and dopamine inputs should arrive in temporal proximity and must follow a specific (dopamine after calcium) order. However, little is known about the cellular mechanism which enforces these temporal constraints on the signal integration. In this computational study, we propose that these temporal requirements emerge as a result of the coordinated signaling via two striatal phosphoproteins, DARPP-32 and ARPP-21. Specifically, DARPP-32-mediated signaling could implement an input-interval dependent gating function, via transient PP1 inhibition, thus enforcing the requirement for temporal proximity. Furthermore, ARPP-21 signaling could impose the additional input-order requirement of calcium and dopamine, due to its Ca2+/calmodulin sequestering property when dopamine arrives first. This highlights the possible role of phosphoproteins in the temporal aspects of striatal signal transduction., A response towards an environmental stimulus could be reinforced if it elicits a reward. On the subcellular level, the environmental stimulus and the reward signal lead to a transient increase in striatal calcium- and dopamine-signaling, respectively. The integration of calcium and dopamine signals, which is important for reward-learning, could elicit a downstream response only if they are close in time and arrive in correct order (first calcium and then dopamine). This study proposes that the requirement for the input signals to be temporally close and in correct order could emerge due to the coordinated signaling via two striatal phosphoproteins, DARPP-32 and ARPP-21. The DARPP-32 signaling implements an input-interval dependent gating function and ARPP-21 implements an input-order dependent threshold-like function. Thus, a molecular mechanism has been presented here which could explain the emergence of important temporal aspects of subcellular signal integration in reward-learning.},

Some functions of CaMKII are mediated by interactions with synaptic proteins, and activity-triggered translocation of CaMKII to synapses has been heavily studied. However, CaMKII actions away from the postsynaptic density (PSD) remain poorly understood, in part because of the difficulty in discerning where CaMKII binds in live cells. We used photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) in rat hippocampal neurons to track single molecules of CaMKIIα, mapping its spatial and kinetic heterogeneity at high resolution. We found that CaMKIIα exhibits at least three kinetic subpopulations, even within individual spines. Latrunculin application or coexpression of CaMKIIβ carrying its actin-binding domain strongly modulated CaMKII diffusion, indicating that a major subpopulation is regulated by the actin cytoskeleton. CaMKII in spines was typically more slowly mobile than in dendrites, consistent with presence of a higher density of binding partners or obstacles. Importantly, NMDA receptor stimulation that triggered CaMKII activation prompted the immobilization and presumed binding of CaMKII in spines not only at PSDs but also at other points up to several hundred nanometers away, suggesting that activated kinase does not target only the PSD. Consistent with this, single endogenous activated CaMKII molecules detected via STORM immunocytochemistry were concentrated in spines both at the PSD and at points quite distant from the synapse. Together, these results indicate that CaMKII mobility within spines is determined by association with multiple interacting proteins, even outside the PSD, suggesting diverse mechanisms by which CaMKII may regulate synaptic transmission.},

Previous studies have most often reported global linear or sublinear summation. An alternative view, supported by biophysical modeling studies, holds that thin dendrites provide a layer of independent computational 'subunits' that sigmoidally modulate their inputs prior to global summation. To distinguish these possibilities, we combined confocal imaging and dual-site focal synaptic stimulation of identified thin dendrites in rat neocortical pyramidal neurons. We found that nearby inputs on the same branch summed sigmoidally, whereas widely separated inputs or inputs to different branches summed linearly. This strong spatial compartmentalization effect is incompatible with a global summation rule and provides the first experimental support for a two-layer 'neural network' model of pyramidal neuron thin-branch integration. Our findings could have important implications for the computing and memory-related functions of cortical tissue.},

	abstract = {How persistent synaptic and spine modification is achieved is essential to our understanding of developmental refinement of neural circuitry and formation of memory. Within a short period after their induction, both types of modifications can either be stabilized or reversed, but how this reversibility is controlled is largely unknown. We have shown previously that AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are delivered to perisynaptic regions after the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) but are absent from perisynaptic regions after the full expression of LTP. Here, we report that perisynaptic AMPARs are GluR2-lacking and they translocate to synapses in a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent manner. Once entering synapses, these AMPARs quickly switch to GluR2-containing in an activity-dependent manner. Absence of postinduction activity or blocking interactions between GluR2 and NSF, or GluR2 and GRIP/PICK1 results in LTP mediated by GluR2-lacking AMPARs. However, these synaptic GluR2-lacking AMPARs are not sufficient to allow reversibility of LTP. On the other hand, postsynaptic inhibition of PKC activity holds AMPARs at perisynaptic regions. As long as perisynaptic AMPARs are present, both LTP and spine expansion remain labile: they can be reverted to the baseline state together with removal of perisynaptic AMPARs, or they can enter a stabilized state of persistent increase together with synaptic incorporation of perisynaptic AMPARs. Thus, perisynaptic GluR2-lacking AMPARs play a critical role in controlling the reversibility of both synaptic and spine modifications.},

	abstract = {CaMKII plays a critical role in decoding calcium (Ca(2+)) signals to initiate long-lasting synaptic plasticity. However, the properties of CaMKII that mediate Ca(2+) signals in spines remain elusive. Here, we measured CaMKII activity in spines using fast-framing two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging. Following each pulse during repetitive Ca(2+) elevations, CaMKII activity increased in a stepwise manner. Thr286 phosphorylation slows the decay of CaMKII and thus lowers the frequency required to induce spine plasticity by several fold. In the absence of Thr286 phosphorylation, increasing the stimulation frequency results in high peak mutant CaMKII(T286A) activity that is sufficient for inducing plasticity. Our findings demonstrate that Thr286 phosphorylation plays an important role in induction of LTP by integrating Ca(2+) signals, and it greatly promotes, but is dispensable for, the activation of CaMKII and LTP.},

The primary focus is on the structure and function of this diverse family of enzymes, and the elegant regulation of their activity. Structures are compared in order to highlight the conserved architecture of their catalytic domains with respect to each other as well as protein kinase A, a prototype for kinase structure. In addition to reviewing structure and function in these enzymes, the variety of biological processes for which they play a mediating role are also examined. Finally, how the enzymes become activated in the intracellular setting is considered by exploring the reciprocal interactions that exist between calcium binding to calmodulin when interacting with the CaM-kinases.},

Two information theoretic quantities, mutual information and channel capacity, were calculated from a pair of action potential trains for detecting a crosscorrelation and estimating synaptic connectivity. The method was compared with conventional ones, using action potential trains obtained by the simulation of a neuron model. This method was shown to have the advantages to more easily find a weak but significant crosscorrelation and to give better estimation of synaptic connectivity independent of the firing probability of a presynaptic neuron.},

	volume = {89},
	issn = {0027-8424},
	abstract = {The time course of habituation and recovery of neurotransmitter release was measured in neuronally differentiated PC12 cells stimulated with either acetylcholine or ATP. The release of norepinephrine in response to either stimulant declined exponentially with repeated presentation of that stimulant. When the stimulus was withheld, the cells' ability to respond recovered to initial levels with an exponential time course. The rate of response recovery depended on the stimulant used and, in the case of stimulation with acetylcholine, on the number of previous stimuli. After habituation and recovery, or partial recovery, of norepinephrine release, the response to a second series of repetitive stimuli declined more rapidly than in the naive case. This increase in habituation rate was dependent on the number of previous stimuli and, in the case of stimulation with acetylcholine, was stable with time for at least 90 min after stimulation. These phenomena are analogous to characteristics of short- and long-term memories of habituative learning observed in behavioral studies. Kinetic equations based on a putative reversible stimulation-dependent inactivation of the cellular response mechanism were used to analyze the rates of habituation and response recovery.},
